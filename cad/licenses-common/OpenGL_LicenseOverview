SGI Free Software License B
URL: http://oss.sgi.com/projects/FreeB

This is SGI's Free Software License "B", version 1.1, used by several of SGI's
projects. The license is available in both PostScript and Microsoft Word
formats. Unfortunately, Microsoft Word's HTML converter introduced errors in
the section numbering, so we've had to remove the HTML version.

History

Version 1.0 of the FreeB license included one term regarding compliance with
defined APIs which posed a problem for some open source developers. We revised
the license in response to those concerns, and instead issued a joint statement
with developers outside SGI satisfying both SGI's needs and those of the
outside developers working with code covered by the FreeB license. The original
1.0 license is available for reference.

The version 1.0 license underwent one minor change in section 8 (defining
"Modifications") on the morning that we went public with it, due to internal
miscommunication. For reference so you can see the change, the originally
posted version of the license is here.
