nanoENGINEER-1 Packaging Instructions
-------------------------------------


WindowsXP
---------

These instructions are for packaging the Python code required by nanoENGINEER-1 for WindowsXP: 

  1) Copy cad/src code souce directory into a packaging directory (i.e. C:/packaging). 
     Make sure NE-1 works from this directory: python atom.py.

  2) Remove all files from C:/packaging/cad/src whose names start with "gpl_only", 
     since these are not legal for us to include with the Windows (non-GPL) distribution.
     These files might include any or all of: 
	
	- gpl_only.py
	- gpl_only.pyc
	- gpl_only_ok
	- gpl_only.pyo (this file may never be there)

     Ideally, also remove butterfly.png and canvas-b-3.py (and any .pyc or .pyo file
     made from it), which are derived from Qt and PyQt example code, and are probably legal
     to distribute, but are just test or example code which is not part of our program.
     
     After removing these files, again make sure NE-1 works from this directory.

  3) Put "setup.py" into C:/packaging.

  4) In a Command Prompt, change directory to C:/packaging and run: 

	python setup.py py2exe --includes sip --excludes OpenGL

     This should create "build" and "dist" directories under C:/packaging.

  5) Copy the "OpenGL" directory from the Python home directory 
     (i.e. C:/python23/Lib/site-packages) to the C:/packages/dist directory.

  6) Change library.zip to library1.zip, create a directory called libary.zip, 
     unzip all the files in library1.zip into directory library.zip.

  7) Copy the "OpenGL" directory into library.zip directory too.

  8) Delete unnecessary files in "dist" and "dist/libary.zip", including:

	- OpenGL extensions
	- py files
	- tcl/tk modules

     *** THIS NEEDS MORE DETAIL *** - Mark 2005-01-18

  9) Copy ImageFile.pyc, JpegImagePlugin.pyc into "dist/libary.zip".

  10) Copy the following DLL files into C:/packages/dist:

	- glut32.dll
	- msvcr71.dll


These instructions are for packaging nanoENGINEER-1 for WindowsXP:

  1) Create a directory to build installation packages (i.e. C:/distribution)

  2) Create the directory C:/distribution/program and copy everything from C:/packaging/dist into it.

  3) Create the directory called C:/distribution/bin and copy the following files into it:

	- assistant.exe (from QTDIR/bin)
	- simulator.exe (from sim/src)

  4) Copy "images" and "doc" from the cad directory into C:/distribution.

  5) Modify "setup.iss" to customize the software installation.  
     Compile it to build "setup.exe" in a directory called "output".



List of 3rd Party Packages required by nanoENGINEER-1 (WindowsXP):

 - GLUT 3.7
 - Numerical Python 22.0
 - PyOpenGL 2.0.1.07
 - Python 2.3.4
 - Python Imaging Library 1.1.4
 - PyQt 3.12
 - Qt 3.3.3
 - SIP 4.0rc4
 - SWIG 1.3.13


MacOS
-----

These instructions are for packaging the Python code required by nanoENGINEER-1 for MacOS: 

  1) Copy cad/src code souce directory into a packaging directory (i.e. C:/packaging). 
     Make sure NE-1 works from this directory: python atom.py.

     Ideally, remove the files butterfly.png and canvas-b-3.py (and any .pyc or .pyo file
     made from it), which are derived from Qt and PyQt example code, and are probably legal
     to distribute, but are just test or example code which is not part of our program.
     
     After removing these files, again make sure NE-1 works from this directory.

  2) Put "setup.py" into C:/packaging.

  3) In a Command Prompt, change directory to C:/packaging and run: 

	python setup.py py2app --includes sip --packages OpenGL

     This should create "build" and "dist" directories under C:/packaging.

  4) Delete unnecessary files in "dist" and "dist/libary.zip", including:

	- OpenGL extensions
	- py files
	- tcl/tk modules


These instructions are for packaging nanoENGINEER-1 for MacOS:

   1) Refer the instructions of packageMaker to build *.pkg file and optionally put the *.pkg into disk image file *.dmg.



Linux

List of 3rd Party Packages required by nanoENGINEER-1 (MacOS):

###@@@ bruce comment 050127: the list below is just a copy of the list for Windows,
and it's definitely not correct since it leaves out bsddb (whose full info and URL
I mailed to the cad list a couple weeks ago). The actual list of packages used
to make the Mac version can be found in mail from me to cad list some time ago
and subsequent email from Huaicai who may have used slightly different packages.
The version numbers might differ from the ones below, and some of the ones below
are not needed since they come with MacOS Panther.

 - GLUT 3.7
 - Numerical Python 22.0
 - PyOpenGL 2.0.1.07
 - Python 2.3.4
 - Python Imaging Library 1.1.4
 - PyQt 3.12
 - Qt 3.3.3
 - SIP 4.0rc4
 - SWIG 1.3.13
