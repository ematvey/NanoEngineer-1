packages needed for atom

(on a new Mandrake 10.0 distro)

Note that the version is not always the latest, and the latest doesn't
always work.

I installed them in this order:

swig 1.13.3  www.swig.org

python 2.3.4 python.org
(only because Mandrake's install misses some development subdirs)

glut 3.7  http://gd.tuwien.ac.at/graphics/GLUT/glut3.html
(in theory this is on SGI as well, but google found this first)

fix the libGL refs in linux/Glut.cf to match your system,
on mine it was /usr/X11R6/lib
follow directions in linux directory
you have to install yourself, copying the .so's to /usr/lib 
and the .h's to /usr/include
