part xxx <comment>
  xxx is vdw, bns, or nil

atom n (e) (x, y, z)
  n is atom number -- intended to rise sequentially from 1
  e is element number, e.g. carbon = 6
  x, y, z, the position in 1e-13m

bond1 <atom #> <atom #> ... (up to 25)
  bonds the last-defined atom to the indicated ones

waals <atom #> <atom #> ... (up to 25)
  indicates vanderwaals interaction to be simulated between
   indicated and last-defined atoms
   (NB vdW interactions are automatically simulated between atoms 
    of different parts)

show xxx
  xxx is vdw, bns, or nil

ground <atom #> <atom #> ... (up to 25)
  given atoms are "welded to space"

motor <torque>, <speed>, (cx, cy, cz) (ax, ay, az) 
  torque in nN*nm (float)
  speed in gHz (float)
  cx, cy, cz is center of rotation (same format as atom posns)
  ax, xy, az is axis of ratation (ditto)

shaft <atom #> <atom #> ... (up to 25) (must follow motor immediately)
  atoms to which the motor is connected

kelvin n
  n is temperature in kelvins (int)
