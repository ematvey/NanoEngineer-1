"""

# context & basic concepts: not described here.

# terminology: C = Command, GM = GraphicsMode.

# The goal is that for each old mode, we have 5 new classes -- 2 main classes
# (its C and GM parts), and 3 "glue" classes that help initialize it --
# one for C-alone, one for GM-alone, and one for a mixed object that has
# both C and GM parts in one instance.
#
# For example, for basicMode these classes are:
# - basicCommand     (main C class)
# - Command          (C-alone glue class)
# - basicGraphicsMode     (main GM class)
# - GraphicsMode          (GM-alone glue class)
# - basicMode     (mixed C/GM glue class)

# The reason we need this is that each glue class has to inherit different
# superclasses and have different __init__ methods. The main differences are
# in how they set up the "cross reference attributes", command.graphicsMode
# and graphicsMode.command, and in whether a command instance has to create
# a new graphicsMode instance. In a mixed object, the command *is* the
# graphicsMode, so it should not create a new one, and each cross-reference
# attribute should be a property pointing to self. In a used-alone object,
# the __init__ method should set up the cross-reference attribute to point
# to another object, and in the command case, it has to create that object
# as a new instance of self.GraphicsMode_class.

# (One other requirement might be some superclasses just for isinstance tests,
# or to revise isinstance tests in other code, probably to just look for the
# basicCommand or basicGraphicsMode part depending on whether they test the
# "current command" or the "current graphicsMode".)

# The mixed object is only needed for compatibility with non-split subclasses
# and to work around bugs from an incomplete split. When it's no longer needed,
# the mixed glue class can be removed, and the other glue classes can be merged
# into the corresponding main classes, with the simpler names retained.
#
# So when basicMode is no longer needed, we'll delete its file (modes.py),
# and merge basicCommand and Command (retaining the name Command),
# and merge basicGraphicsMode and GraphicsMode (retaining the name
# GraphicsMode). But this can only happen when all subclasses are split, i.e.
# when every mode in NE1 is split.

# ===

# So, here is how this should be done with selectMode.
# After that, we'll show how to do it with its subclass selectMolsMode.

# First define classes which can work in either split C & GM form, or mixed form,
# which have most of the methods for each side. Each one has an init method which
# can call its superclass's init method, but which should not call any of the
# "glue init methods" in the superclass. The init methods should have the same
# arg signature as in their superclass.

# (In real life, these would go into different files, described later.
#  For clarity in this demo, they are all in one file.)

# We do the graphics part first since the command part has to refer to it.
#
# Its superclass, in general, should be another _basicGraphicsMode class.
# (In fully split modes that don't need mixed versions, it can also be the
#  value of command_superclass.GraphicsMode_class where command_superclass
#  is what the corresponding Command class inherits, or it can just be a
#  non-basic GraphicsMode class named directly, which should be the
#  same one used in the command superclass. But for modes with mixed versions,
#  it should just be the basicGraphicsMode version of the superclass
#  GraphicsMode.)

class Select_basicGraphicsMode(basicGraphicsMode):
    def __init__(self, glpane):

        basicGraphicsMode.__init__(self, glpane)
        # Now do whatever might be needed to init the graphicsMode object,
        # or the graphicsMode-related attrs of the mixed object.
        #
        # (Similar comments apply as for Select_basicCommand.__init__, below,
        #  but note that for GraphicsModes, there is no Enter method.
        #  Probably we will need to add something like an Enter_graphicsMode
        #  method to the GraphicsMode API. In the meantime, the command's Enter
        #  method has to initialize the graphicsMode object's attrs (which are
        #  the graphics-related attrs of self, in the mixed case, but are
        #  referred to as self.graphicsMode.attr so this will work in the split
        #  case as well), which is a kluge.)

        # Enter, since they should be reinitialized every time we enter the
        # command anyway.

    # needs to call the other. This requires some thought in each case

# putting these into the right files:

# in Select_Command we want that class, but first its basic version, Select_basicCommand.

# in Select_GraphicsMode we want that class, but first, Select_basicGraphicsMode.

# and in selectMode.py (same name as original mode) we want class selectMode as above.

# And several imports are needed to make this work, but they should be obvious
# from the NameErrors that come from forgetting them, e.g. of GLPANE_IS_COMMAND_SEQUENCER,
# anyMode, other superclasses.

# ==

# For SelectChunks, we'd make, in 3 files, and following the above pattern,
# but revising all superclass occurrences:

# SelectChunks_Command.py:
# SelectChunks_basicCommand inheriting Select_basicCommand
# SelectChunks_Command inheriting SelectChunks_basicCommand

# SelectChunks_GraphicMode.py
# SelectChunks_basicGraphicsMode inheriting Select_basicGraphicsMode
# SelectChunks_GraphicMode inheriting SelectChunks_basicGraphicsMode

# selectMolsMode.py (same name as old file):
# selectMolsMode, inheriting SelectChunk_basicCommand, SelectChunks_basicGraphicsMode

# ==

# If this all works right, then recombined versions of split/recombined mode classes will
# keep working with no problem at all, and so will their non-split subclasses,
# with no changes at all (except perhaps in isinstance tests).

# Not covered above:
#
# - when you'd need to add more stuff to the glue classes than what is copied/modified from their superclasses
#
# - how to use debug_prefs to test either _Command or mixed classes -- basically,
#   maybe easiest to use a hardcoded assignment instead, to put the _Command class into the GLPane list of modes
#   (I think that's right -- check what's done for PanMode etc to be sure)
#
# - what will still not work in the split case -- uses of one part's method or attr from the other part --
#   easiest fix is to change self.attr to self.command.attr for a command attr used in the GM part,
#   and to change self.attr to self.graphicsMode.attr for a GM attr used in the C part.
#   or you can use a property in a single place in the alone-case glue class.
#   But you have to decide where an attr belongs; it's not always obvious,
#   e.g. hover_highlighting_enabled belongs in C part though it's mainly used in GM part,
#   since C part is what wants to set it in certain circumstances. 
#
# - I think there was something else I forgot.
