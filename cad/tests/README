Unit Tests
-=-=-=-=-=-
Python supports unit testing with the PyUnit module.
Information about PyUnit is available at this website:
  http://pyunit.sourceforge.net/pyunit.html

Bloggy ramblings about PyUnit:

  http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2005/02/03/tdd_pyunit2.html

Run the unit tests from the cad/tests/ directory with the following bash shell
command:
  $ ./runAllTests.sh
  
Run individual test suites with:
  $ PYTHONPATH=../src python TESTFILE.py -v

  
[WARNING: if this uses a different python executable than you normally run
on atom.py to start nE-1, you might need to remove *.pyc before and after
running these tests, to avoid any chance of incompatible .pyc files messing
up nE-1. This is not supposed to happen, but for certain Mac Pythons I have
had this problem. -- comment added by bruce 051005]
