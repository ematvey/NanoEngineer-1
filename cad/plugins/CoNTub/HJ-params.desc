# Parameter-set description file. 

# This describes the parameters needed to generate a heterojunction
# (one of several structures that can be generated by this plugin),
# with info about how they can be presented in a parameter-editing dialog.

### WARNING: some fields are stubs, and the toplevel constructor is misconceived and needs revision --
# it should be something like parameter_set, not generator.

        # border_icon is used in dialog window border (on some platforms) (maybe nim).
        # All these icons can be found in ./, ./images, or NE-1 builtin images (maybe nim).
        # Future: if we let the plugin author specify that path, that default value might look like
        # icon_path = "$plugin", "$plugin/images", "$images" 
        # (where $images refers to a built-in pathname of things plugins are allowed to look at).
