QuteMol
What's new

Ver 0.4.1: (Nanorex compatibility release)
----------

Minor Features:
 - Now "Atom Rendering Tables" (ART) are accepted from the command line
   (with "-a <filename>" ).
     The ART file is a text file redefining colors and space-fill radii of
   atom elements, as well as defining new atom (or pseudoatom) types as needed.
     This is done to add extra flexibility, making QuteMol more usable as a 
   viewer for other applications, like for example Nanorex (for more info about 
   this, see 
   http://www.nanoengineer-1.net/mediawiki/index.php?title=QuteMol_plug-in )
     See art_example.txt for an example of accepted ART files.
   
Bugfixes:
 - Minor fixes. 

Ver 0.4:
--------

New Features:
 - Color per chain selectable.
     (rather then per atom). Random color schemas can be cycled.
 - Export of GIF animation
     Is is now possible to export GIF animations featuring the 
     current model under inspections (useful for websites?)

Minor Features:
 - Progress bar shown during any long processing task (which can be cancelled)! 
 - Various minor speed improvements
 - Save snapshot dialog to change the resolution of the fly

Bugfixes:
 - Link to Qutemol webpage fixed (now using wxWidgets v. 8.0)
 - Fixed a bug that prevented some 2-letter atoms to be correctly understood
 - Fixed the clipping plane bug (large molecules where shown as if cut in half)
 - Various minor fixes

 
Ver 0.3:
--------

New Features:
 - On screen antialiasing.
     This improves visual quality, especially when
     using thin borders. Since it is only activated
     (by default) when the molecule is still this feature
     does not affect fps. You can disable this option by setting
     the STILL_QUALITY parameter equal to 100 in the
     configuration file "qutemol.cfg".
 - Faster (lower quality) rendering option for slower computers.
     You can set a MOVING_QUALITY parameter lower than
     the default 100 in the configuration file "qutemol.cfg".
     If you do, QuteMol will feature a less sharp, but faster,
     rendering as long as you are roteting the molecule (and
     still show the crisp version when you stop moving it).
 - Saving snapshots as PNG with transparent background.
     The saved images can have an alpha channel that allows
     high quality composition. You can select this option
     in the "save a snapshot" dialog by choosing the
     "Transparent PNG" file type.
 - Texture autoresize.
     You no longer have to manually adapt the size of the texture
     to cope with the global illumination on larger molecules. Rather,
     you can specify the maximal texture size available on your card
     (the default value of 2048 is ok on most cards).

Minor Features:
 - Molecule name on titlebar.
 - Molecule info on F1
 - A couple new presets.

Improvements:
 - Border effect reworked.
     Their thickness is made somewhat scale dependent.
     They now work on ball'n'sticks and liquorice mode as well.
     Simplified settings. Improved performance
 - Halo effect reworked.
     Added a few settings (strength, depth-awareness). Improved
     performance
 - Better icon :)

Bugfixes:
 - Shapshot size
     Used to be halved (w.r.t. the setting specified in qutemol.cfg).
 - Halos
     Minor visual error fixed (was most visible on smaller molecules).
     Fixed behavior on atom bonds.
 - Dark bonds fixed
     On some molecule, some bonds would appear darker than it should
 - Shadowmap sizes:
     Shadowmap used for global illumination is now decoupled from shadowmap
     used during rendering. This allows for much smaller settings for the former,
     leading to faster global illumination computation.


Ver 0.2:
--------
- Bugfixes (most notably snapshot tool fixed)
- New presets


Ver 0.1:
---------
first public release!
