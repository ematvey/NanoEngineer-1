QuteMol is an open source (GPL), interactive, high quality molecular
visualization system. QuteMol exploits the current GPU capabilites through
OpenGL shaders to offers an array of innovative visual effects. QuteMol
visualization techniques are aimed at improving clarity and an easier
understanding of the 3D shape and structure of large molecules or complex
proteins.

- Real Time Ambient Occlusion
- Depth Aware Silhouette Enhancement
- Ball and Sticks, Space-Fill and Liquorice visualization modes
- High resolution antialiased snapshot for publication quality renderings
- Interactive rendering of large molecules and protein (100k atoms)
- Standard PDB input

QuteMol was developed by Marco Tarini and Paolo Cignoni of the Visual
Computing Lab at  ISTI - CNR

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Warning: QuteMol exploits the latest features of OpenGL shading language.
So QuteMol needs a graphics hardware that supports fragment shaders and
framebuffer objects. It is also recommended to always install the latest
graphics drivers from your manufacturer.
