These files are used by Dna.py to create PAM-5 DNA structures in the 
CAD program:

- StartBasePair.mmp
- MiddleBasePair.mmp
- EndBasePair.mmp
- SingleBasePair.mmp

Each file contains two "Ss" (Sugar) pseudo atoms named "a" and "b" (via the 
new Atom "dnaBaseName" info records) which get assigned their permanent 
base letters when the DNA structure is generated (see Dna.make()). 
The "a" atom belongs to "Strand1" and atom "b" (the complement of "a") belongs
to "Strand2".
