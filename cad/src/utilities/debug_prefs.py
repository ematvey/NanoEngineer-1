    """
    Public function for declaring and registering a debug pref and querying its value.
       Example call: chem.py rev 1.151 (might not  be present in later versions).
       Details: If debug_prefs[name] is known (so far in this session),
    return its current value, and perhaps record the fact that it was used.
       If it's not known, record its existence in the list of active debug prefs
    (visible in a submenu of the debug menu [#e and/or sometimes on the dock])
    and set it to have datatype dtype, with an initial value of dtype's default value,
    or as determined from prefs db if prefs_key option is passed and if this pref has been stored there.
    (Treat dtype's default value as prefs db default value, in that case.)
    (And then record usage and return value, just as in the other case.)
       If prefs_key is passed, also arrange to store changes to its value in user prefs db.
    The prefs_key option can be True (meaning use the name as the key, after a hardcoded prefix),
    or a string (the actual prefs key).
       If non_debug option is true, pref is available even to users who don't set ATOM-DEBUG.
       If call_with_new_value is passed (as a named argument -- no positional call is supported),
    and is not None, it will be called with the new value whenever the value is changed from the
    debug menu. It will NOT be called immediately with the current value, since some debug prefs
    are called extremely often, and since the caller can easily do this if desired. If this option
    was passed before (for the same debug_pref), the old function will be discarded and not called again.
       WARNING: the call_with_new_value function is only called for changes caused by use of the debug menu;
    it probably should also be called for prefs db changes done by other means, but that's not yet
    implemented. (It will be easy to add when it's needed.)
