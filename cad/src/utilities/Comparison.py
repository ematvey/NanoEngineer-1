same_vals was written as part of state_utils.py [bruce]

moved same_vals into utilities/Comparison.py to break an import cycle
[ericm 071005]

moved SAMEVALS_SPEEDUP and "import samevals" along with it
(but left the associated files in cad/src, namely samevals.c [by wware],
setup2.py [now in outtakes], and part of Makefile) [bruce 071005]

    Efficiently scan v1 and v2 in parallel to determine whether they're the same, for purposes of undoable state
    or saved state.
       The only reason we really need this (as opposed to just using Python '==' or '!=' and our own __eq__ methods)
    is because Numeric.array.__eq__ is erroneously defined, and if we were using '==' or '!=' on a Python tuple containing 
    a Numeric array, we'd have no way of preventing this issue from making '==' or '!=' come out wrong on the tuple.

    (For details, see bruce email to 'all' of 060302, partially included below.)

    [...]
    It turns out that you can safely naively use != on Numeric arrays,
    but not ==, since they both act elementwise, and this only 
    does what you usually want with != . I knew this in the past
    (and fixed some weird bugs caused by it) but forgot it recently,
    so Undo was thinking that atom position arrays had not changed
    provided at least one coordinate of one atom had not changed.
    [...]
    - Bruce

    In particular:

    a = Numeric.array((1, 2, 3))
    b = Numeric.array((1, 2, 3))
    assert a == b                  # result: [1 1 1], interpreted as True
    assert not a != b              # result: [0 0 0], interpreted as False
    b = Numeric.array((1, 4, 5))
    assert a != b                  # result: [1 0 0], interpreted as True
    assert not a == b              # result: [0 1 1], interpreted as True
    # the last assertion fails!

    Do the maintainers of Numeric consider this to be correct
    behavior?!?!?!?  Probably.

    What they should have done was define a new ufunc for equality
    testing, and made the semantics of __eq__ and __ne__ work as
    expected.  Probably too late to expect them to change this now.

       As long as we have it, we might as well make it a bit more stringent than Python '==' in other ways too,
    like not imitating the behaviors (which are good for '==') of 1.0 == 1, array([1]) == [1], etc. The only reason
    we'll count non-identical objects as equal is that we're not interested in their addresses or in whether someone
    will change one of them and not the other (for whole objects or for their parts).

### UNDECIDED. For now, doing nothing is equivalent to Choice 1.
# but note that choice 2 is probably safer.
# in fact, if I do that, i'd no longer need _eq_id_mixin just due to StateMixin. (only when __getattr__ and someone calls '==')
# [060303]
# Update 060306: some objects will need _s_same_as(self, other) different from __eq__,
# since __eq__ *might* want to compare some components with != (like int and float) rather than be as strict as same_vals.
# Even __eq__ needs to try to avoid the "Numeric array in list" bug, which in some cases will force it to also call same_vals,
# but when types are known it's plausible that it won't have to, so the distinct methods might be needed.
# When we first need _s_same_as, that will force use of a new _same_InstanceType_helper func.
# Do we need it before then? Not sure. Maybe not; need to define __eq__ better in GAMESS Jig (bug 1616) but _s_same_as
# can probably be the same method. OTOH should we let DataMixin be the thing that makes _s_same_as default to __eq__?? ###

# update, bruce 060419, after thinking about bug 1869 (complaint about different bonds with same key):
# - The Bond object needs to use id for sameness, in Undo diffs at least (only caller of same_vals?) (but can't use id for __eq__ yet).
#   - Q: What is it about Bond that decides that -- Bond? StateMixin? not DataMixin?
#     A: The fact that scan_children treats it as a "child object", not as a data object (see obj_is_data method).
#     That's what makes Undo change attrs in it, which only makes sense if Undo treats refs to it (in values of other attrs,
#      which it's diffing) as the same iff their id is same.
# Conclusion: we need to use the same criterion in same_vals, via a new _same_InstanceType_helper -- *not* (only) a new method
# as suggested above and in a comment I added to bug 1869 report. For now, we don't need the new method at all.
