icon_utilities.py - helper functions for finding icon and pixmap files
in standard places, and caching them, and handling errors when they're
not found.

$Id: icon_utilities.py 12744 2008-05-13 21:11:31Z marksims $

History: developed by several authors; moved out of Utility.py
by bruce 070831.

WARNING: most code still imports these functions from Utility.py.
This should be cleaned up when practical.

TODO:

Most of the code in these functions could probably be merged
into fewer functions.

Module classification: these are used for both widgets and 3d graphics,
so they need to be classified lower than either. The file might be
considered a utility, but it does a lot of io, so we can classify it
as io for now. (Another possibility would be platform.) [bruce 071214]
