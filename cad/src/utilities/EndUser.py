  EndUser.py

  Some program features are intended specifically for developers, and
  are best left disabled for end users.  Examples might be debugging
  prints, and the ability to reload a changed module.  Such code is
  wrapped with a test which calls enableDeveloperFeatures() here.

  Early in startup, setDeveloperFeatures() should be called after
  detecting if this is an end user or developer run.  Until this is
  called, enableDeveloperFeatures() will default to False, indicating
  an end user run (but will print a bug warning if it's ever called then).
