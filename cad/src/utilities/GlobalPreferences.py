GlobalPreferences.py

Routines that test for various global user preferences.

Note: this module is likely to be imported early, and should be
considered a low level support module.  As such, importing it should
not drag in much else.  As of 2007/09/05, that's probably not true
yet. [That goal may be impractical and not really necessary, given
the kinds of things in it so far -- bruce 080220 comment]
