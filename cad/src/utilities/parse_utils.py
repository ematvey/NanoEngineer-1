parse_utils.py -- utilities for general parsing, and for parsing streams of python tokens.
Also a prototype "description class" which can be used to represent results of parsing a "description".
Also an example grammar, which can be used for parsing "parameter-set description files".
(FYI: All these things are used to parse "parameter dialog description files", *.desc.)

TODO:

This ought to be split into several files, and generalized, and ThingData renamed
and cleaned up. And optimized (easy), since the parser is probably quadratic time
in input file size, at least when used in the usual way, on a list that comes
from generate_tokens.
