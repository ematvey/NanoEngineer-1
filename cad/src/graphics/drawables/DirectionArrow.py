History:
ninad 2007-06-12: Created this class (initially) to support the implementation 
of 'offset plane' (was created in Plane.py) 
ninad 2007-08-20: Split it out of Plane.py into this new file. 

TODO:
- Need to implement some grid plane features. 
- Plane should be selectable when clicked anywhere inside.
