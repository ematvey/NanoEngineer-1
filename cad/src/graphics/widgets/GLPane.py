GLPane.py -- NE1's main model view, based on Qt's OpenGL widget.

Mostly written by Josh; partly revised by Bruce for mode code revision, 040922-24.
Revised by many other developers since then (and perhaps before).

Module classification: [bruce 080104]

It's graphics/widgets, but this is not as obvious as it sounds.
It is "optimistic", as if we'd already refactored -- it's not fully
accurate today.

Refactoring needed: [bruce 080104]

- split into several classes (either an inheritance tree, or cooperating
objects);

- move more common code into GLPane_minimal;

- most urgently, make the main GLPane not be the
same object as the CommandSequencer.

Some of this might be a prerequisite for some ways of
optimizing the graphics code.
