bruce 070914 made this to remind us that GLPane and ThumbView
need a common superclass (and have common code that needs merging).
It needs to be in its own file to avoid import loop problems.

    # refactored a bit, e.g. so that self.animateToView works in other
    # subclassses even if it doesn't animate. Ultimately it might be better
    # to refactor them a lot and/or move them out of this class hierarchy
    # entirely. [bruce 080912 comment]
