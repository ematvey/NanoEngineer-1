Explanation of code:

# The following comment comes from emails exchanged between Russ and Piotr
# on 080403.
#        
# This code is based on the information from OpenGL FAQ on clipping and culling:
# http://www.opengl.org/resources/faq/technical/clipping.htm
#
# I tried to dust off the math behind it and I found the following paper
# dealing with the homogeneous coordinates in great detail:
# http://www.unchainedgeometry.com/jbloom/pdf/homog-coords.pdf
#
# The computations are in homogeneous coordinates, so every vertex is 
# represented by four coordinates (x,y,z,w). The composite matrix C (cmat 
# in the code) transforms a point from the Euclidean coordinates to the 
# homogeneous coordinates.
#
# Let's transform a point p(xp,yp,zp,wp) using the computed composite 
# matrix:
#
# C[4][4] (in 3D Euclidean space, wp = 1):
#
# r = p^T * C
#
# so we get a transformed point r(p*C0,p*C1,p*C2,p*C3), where Cx represents
# a corresponding row of the matrix C. In homogeneous coordinates, if 
# the transformed point is inside the viewing frustum, the following 
# inequalities have to be true:
#
# -wr < xr < wr
# -wr < yr < wr
# -wr < zr < wr
#
# So if -wr < xr, the point p is on + side of the left frustum plane, 
# if xr < wr it is on + side of the right frustum plane, if -wr < yr, 
# the point is on + side of the bottom plane, and so on. Let's take the 
# left frustum plane:
# 
# -wr < xr
#
# so:
# 
# -p*C3 < p*C0
# 
# so:
#
# 0 < p*C0+p*C3
# 
# that is equal to:
# 
# 0 < p*(C0+C3)
# 
# which gives us the plane equation (ax+bx+cx+d=0):
# 
# x*(C0[0]+C3[0]) + y*(C0[1]+C3[1]) + z*(C0[2]+C3[2]) + w(C0[3]+C3[3]) = 0
# 
# Because w = 1:
# 
# x*(C0[0]+C3[0]) + y*(C0[1]+C3[1]) + z*(C0[2]+C3[2]) + (C0[3]+C3[3]) = 0
# 
# so the plane coefficients are as follows:
# 
# a = C0[0] + C3[0]
# b = C0[1] + C3[1]
# c = C0[2] + C3[2]
# d = C0[3] + C3[3]
# 
# Similarly, for the right plane (xr < wr) we get:
#
# a = -C0[0] + C3[0]
# b = -C0[1] + C3[1]
# c = -C0[2] + C3[2]
# d = -C0[3] + C3[3]
# 
# and so on for every plane.
