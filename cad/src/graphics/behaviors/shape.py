History:

By Josh. Portions rewritten or extended by at least Bruce & Huaicai,
perhaps others.

Bruce 071215 split classes CookieShape and Slab into their own modules.

Module classification and refactoring:  [bruce 071215]

Perhaps SelectionShape should also be split out?
The rest seems pretty closely integrated, though it may still be
"vertically integrated" in the sense of combining several kinds of
code, including geometry, graphics_behavior (incl selection),
maybe more.

The public defs are at least get_selCurve_color,
simple_shape_2d, shape, SelectionShape. For now, I'll guess
that I can call all these "graphics_behavior". We'll see.
(This feels more natural than "operations", though for that
I'd be more confident that a package import cycle was unlikely.)

    [helper for class curve; unknown whether it has other uses]
    
    Fill a curve drawn in matrix mat, as 1's over a background of 0's, with 1's.
    p is V(i, j) of a point to fill from. dir is 1 or -1 for the
    standard recursive fill algorithm.

    Here is an explanation of how this is used and how it works then, by Huaicai:
    This function is used to fill the area between the rectangle bounding box and the boundary
    of the curve with 1's. The bounding box is extended by (lower left corner -2, right top corner + 2). 
    The curve boundary is filled with 1's. So mat[1,:] = 0, mat[-1,:] = 0, mat[:, 1] = 0;
    mat[:, -1]=0, which means the area is connected. If we start from mat[1, 1], dir = 1, then we scan the 
    first line from left to right. If it's 0, fill it as 1 until we touch 1. For each element in the line, we also 
    check it's neighbor above and below. For the neighbor elements, if the neighbor touches 1 but 
    previous neighbor is 0, then scan the neighbor line in the reverse order. I think this algorithm is better
    than the simple recursive flood filling algorithm. The seed mat[1, 1] is always inside the area, and 
    most probably this filling area is smaller than that inside the curve. I think it also reduces repeated 
    checking/filling of the classical algorithm.
