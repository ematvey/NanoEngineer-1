confirmation_corner.py -- helpers for modes with a confirmation corner
(or other overlay widgets).

@copyright: 2007-2008 Nanorex, Inc.  See LICENSE file for details.

Note: confirmation corners make use of two methods added to the "GraphicsMode API"
(the one used by GLPane to interface to glpane.graphicsMode for mouse and drawing)
for their sake, currently [071015] defined only in basicGraphicsMode:
draw_overlay, and mouse_event_handler_for_event_position. These are general enough
to handle all kinds of overlays, in principle, but the current implem and
some API details may be just barely general enough for the confirmation
corner.

Those method implems assume that Command subclasses (whose instances are
found in graphicsMode.command) override want_confirmation_corner_type
to return the kind of confirmation corner they want at a given moment.
