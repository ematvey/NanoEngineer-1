        """
        Create an nEImageOps object that holds a PIL image made from the given image filename, imageName.
        Not all file formats are supported; the file extension is not enough to know if the file is supported,
        since it also depends on the nature of the internal data (which is probably a bug that could be fixed).
        [#doc the convert option, which tries to address that [not fully tested], and the _tmpmode option.]
           The image will be resized on demand by getTextureData (but in place in this mutable object,
        thus affecting all subsequent queries too, not only queries via getTextureData),
        to ideal_width, ideal_height, specified as options, or if they're not supplied, by a debug_pref "image size",
        or by direct modification by client of self.ideal_width and self.ideal_height before this resizing is first done.
        (Callers which want no resizing to occur currently need to explicitly set self.ideal_width and self.ideal_height
        to the actual image size (before first calling getTextureData), which can be determined as explained below.
        Or, as of 'kluge070304', they can pass -1 for ideal_width and/or ideal_height to make them equal that dim of the native size.
        Note that this entire API is basically a kluge, and ought to be cleaned up sometime. ##e)
           For many OpenGL drivers, if the image will be used as texture data, these sizes need to be powers of two.
           The resizing will be done by rescaling, by default, or by padding on top and right if rescale = False.
           The original dimensions can be found in self.orig_width and self.orig_height [untested];
        these never change after first reading the file (even when we internally reread the file in self.update,
        to work around bugs).
           The current dimensions can be found by knowing that width = self.img.size[0] and height = self.img.size[1].
        If getTextureData has been called, these presumably equal the ideal dims, but I [bruce] don't know if this is always true.
           The PIL image object is stored in the semi-public attribute self.img, but this object often replaces that image
        with a new one, with altered data and/or size, either due to resizing for getTextureData, or to external calls of
        one of several image-modifying methods.
