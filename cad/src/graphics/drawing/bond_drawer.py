# ==

# To modularize drawing, I'll pass in a drawing place which has methods like
# drawcylinder, which can be either the drawer module itself (or an object made
# here to encapsulate it) or a writepov-to-specific-file object. This is
# experimental code, so for now it's only here in bond_drawer.py.
#
# In the future, it should be created once per writepov event, and write the
# povheader, and then it should be passed in to individual writepov
# routines. Farther ahead, it should be able to write new macros which embody
# env.prefs values as needed, so individual atom/bond drawing calls don't need
# to each incorporate the effects of prefs values, but so that single macros can
# be revised manually in the output file to effectively change prefs values (a
# longstanding NFR from the SAB).
