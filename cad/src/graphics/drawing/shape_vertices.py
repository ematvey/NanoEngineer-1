shape_vertices.py - Geometric constructions of vertex lists used
                    by the drawing functions.

This includes vertices for the shapes of primitives that will go into display
lists in the setup_drawer function in setup_draw.py .

History:

Originated by Josh as drawer.py .

Various developers extended it since then.

Brad G. added ColorSorter features.

At some point Bruce partly cleaned up the use of display lists.

071030 bruce split some functions and globals into draw_grid_lines.py
and removed some obsolete functions.

080210 russ Split the single display-list into two second-level lists (with and
without color) and a set of per-color sublists so selection and hover-highlight
can over-ride Chunk base colors.  ColorSortedDisplayList is now a class in the
parent's displist attr to keep track of all that stuff.

080311 piotr Added a "drawpolycone_multicolor" function for drawing polycone
tubes with per-vertex colors (necessary for DNA display style)

080313 russ Added triangle-strip icosa-sphere constructor, "getSphereTriStrips".

080420 piotr Solved highlighting and selection problems for multi-colored
objects (e.g. rainbow colored DNA structures).

080519 russ pulled the globals into a drawing_globals module and broke drawer.py
into 10 smaller chunks: glprefs.py setup_draw.py shape_vertices.py
ColorSorter.py CS_workers.py CS_ShapeList.py CS_draw_primitives.py drawers.py
gl_lighting.py gl_buffers.py

# ==

# Instead of the above recursive scheme that orients the icosahedron with the
# midpoints of six edges perpendicular to the major axes, use a ring approach
# to make subdivided icosa-spheres for Triangle Strips.  The vertices are
# grouped in rings from the North Pole to the South Pole.  Each strip zig-zags
# between two rings, and the poles are surrounded by pentagonal Triangle Fans.
#
# ----------------
#
# The pattern of five-fold vertices in a "twisted orange-slice" segment
# covering one-fifth of the icosahedron is:
#
#               ... [3,0] ... (North Pole)
#                   / | \
#                 /   |  ...
#               /     |

#                \ /     \ /
#           ... [1,1]---[1,0] ...
#                 |     /
#             ... |   /
#               \ | /
#           ... [0,0] ...     (South Pole)
#
# ----------------
#
# Higher subdivision levels step the strip verts along the icos edges,
# interpolating intermediate points on the icos and projecting each onto the
# sphere.  Note: sphere vertex normals are the same as their coords.

#
# The reason for rotating east, then going west along the latitude lines, is
# that the "grain" of triangle strip diagonals runs that way in the middle
# band of the icos:
#
#     Triangle Strip triangles
#
#        6 ----- 4 ----- 2
#         \5,4,6/ \3,2,4/ \
#     ...  \   /   \   /   \
#           \ /3,4,5\ /1,2,3\
#            5 ----- 3 ----- 1  <- Vertex order
#
# This draws triangles 1-2-3, 3-2-4, 3-4-5, and 5-4-6, all counter-clockwise
# so the normal directions don't flip-flop.
#
# ----------------
#
# This version optimizes by concatenating vertices for separate Triangle Fan
# and Triangle Strip calls into a single long Triangle Strip to minimize calls.
#
# In the "pentagon cap" band at the top of the icos, points 2, 4, and 6 in the
# above example are collapsed to the North Pole; at the bottom, points 1, 3,
# and 5 are collapsed to the South Pole.  This makes "null triangles" with one
# zero-length edge, and the other two edges echoing one of the other triangle
# edges (5,4,6 and 3,2,4 at the top, and 3,4,5 and 1,2,3 at the bottom.)
#
# In the subdivided caps, the icosahedron bands are split into horizontal
# sub-bands.  In the tapering-in sub-bands in the North cap, there is one less
# vertex on the top edges of sub-bands, so we collapse the *LAST* triangle
# there (e.g. 5,4,6 above)  On the bottom edges of the South cap bands there
# is one less vertex, so we collapse the *FIRST* triangle (e.g. 1,2,3.)
#
# Similarly, moving from the end of each sub-band to the beginning of the next
# requires a *pair* of null triangles.  We get that by simply concatenating the
# wrapped triangle strips.  We orient point pairs in the triangle strip from
# south to north, so this works as long as we jog northward between (sub-)bands.
# This is the reason we start the Triangle Strip with the South Pole band.
