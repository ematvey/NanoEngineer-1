bruce 050906 translated into Python some Lisp code
contributed by Dr. K. Eric Drexler.

bruce 071030 moved inferBonds interface to that code (probably by Will) here,
from bonds.py.

TODO: make this directly accessible as one or more user operations.
(As of 071030 it's only used when importing some PDB files.)

# This code does not yet consider the possibility of non-sp3 atomtypes,

Eric D writes: If the bond-number limit for each atom is based on its
atom-type, rather than on its element-type, there should be no
problem. Or, if atom-types are unknown, then we can use the maximum
valence for that atom that occurs in non-exotic chemistry. Damian
should cross-check this, but I'd use:

H  1
B  4
C  4
N  4
O  2
F  1
Si 4
P  5
S  4
Cl 1

Many elements can have any one of several atomtypes based on
hybridization. Our concepts of these appear in the _mendeleev table in
elements.py. So for each element there is a minimum number of possible
bonds and a maximum number of possible bonds; for carbon these are
respectively 2 (two double bonds for sp hybridization) and 4 (sp3).

There are two things that could be the independent variable. Either
you derive the atomtype from the number of bonds, or you hold the
atomtype fixed and permit only the number of bonds it allows.

Currently max_atom_bonds() is looking at
atom.element.atomtypes[0].numbonds to determine how many bonds are OK
for this atom. That presumes the first atomtype permits the most bonds,
which is presently [and still, 071101] true, but it would be better
to take an explicit maximum.

So we DO want the maximum number of bonds for ANY atomtype for this
element, with the presumption that somebody else will later
rehybridize the atom to get the right atomtype. We don't need to do
that here.

The other messy thing is this: If we know we don't have enough bonds
for the element (i.e. fewer than the smallest number of bonds for any
of its atomtypes) then we should use MAX_DIST_RATIO = 2.0 because we
are hungry for more bonds. When we get enough for the minimum, we
reduce MAX_DIST_RATIO to 1.4 because we're not so hungry any more.

MAX_DIST_RATIO is used in two places. One is in list_potential_bonds,
where we clearly want this policy. (Complication: there are two
atoms involved - we will use the smaller value only when BOTH are
non-hungry.) The other place is atm_distance_cost, another case
where there are two atoms involved. I think it applies there too.
