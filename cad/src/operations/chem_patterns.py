chem_patterns.py

Commands and other code related to finding simple patterns of bonded atoms.

Todo later:
- really turn O into 8 and reverse rules as needed
- might need to also check bondtypes or atomtypes someday... problematic since they might be wrong to start with.
- might want to also select bad-valence atoms, or have another command for that.
- might need a few more kinds of patterns, like one for just 2 atoms... wait and see what's suggested.
