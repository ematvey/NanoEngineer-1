pastables.py -- identifying and using nodes that can be pasted

History:

Bruce circa 050121 split these out of existing code in depositMode,
probably by Josh, and generalized them (but left them in that file)

Ninad 2007-08-29 moved them into Utility.py and extended or
modified them

bruce 071026 moved them from Utility into a new file

TODO:

- All these functions probably need cleanup and generalization.
More importantly, they need to be methods in the Node API with
implementations on a few subclasses of Node.

- A longstanding NFR is to be able to define a hotspot in a Group
and paste it onto a bondpoint.
