        # but for now, I removed the msg_about_click option, since it's no longer used,

        # describe_leftDown_action, which I'll also remove or comment out. [bruce 071025]
        return not new_selobj_unknown # from update_selobj

the def of update_selatom that had code for msg_about_click was in selectAtomsMode.
that code was:

-        if msg_about_click: 
-            # [always do the above, since many things can change what it should 
-            # say] Come up with a status bar message about what we would paste
-            # now.
-            # [bruce 050124 new feature, to mitigate current lack of model 
-            # tree highlighting of pastable]
-            msg = self.describe_leftDown_action( glpane.selatom)
-            env.history.statusbar_msg( msg)

removing this has also made more depositMode methods have no calls:

TODO: also check for calls of
posn_str,[still used! but NOT DEFINED IN selMode which uses it! ### FIX]
viewing_main_part,[still used!]
pastable_atomtype, [still used!]
and maybe uses of
self.w.depositState, [still used]
self.pastable, [still used]
          
is_pastable_onto_singlet, [still used but no longer need imports in depmode]
is_pastable_into_free_space [ditto]
