TreeView.py -- NO LONGER USED IN Qt4 NE1

 -- display and update, for a tree widget based on QTreeView,
and meant to display Nodes (with interface and semantics as in Utility.py).

Assumes each node is shown in at most one place in the widget.
This could in theory be changed (see code for details).

$Id: TreeView.py 11858 2008-03-07 04:58:31Z ericmessick $

History: modelTree.py was originally written by some combination of
Huaicai, Josh, and Mark. Bruce (Jan 2005) reorganized its interface with
Node and Group and their subclasses (Utility.py and other modules)
and rewrote a lot of the model-tree code (to fix bugs and add features),
and split it into three modules:
- TreeView.py (display and update),
- TreeWidget.py (event handling, and some conventions suitable for
  all our tree widgets, if we define other ones), and
- modelTree.py (customized for showing a "model tree" per se).
