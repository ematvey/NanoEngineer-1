History:
depositMode.py Originally by Josh Hall and then significantly modified by 
several developers. 

In January 2008, the old depositMode class was split into new Command and 
GraphicsMode parts and the these classes were moved into their own module 
[ See BuildAtoms_Command.py and BuildAtoms_GraphicsMode.py]
