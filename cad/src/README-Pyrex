Related source files:

  pyrex_test.pyx
      contains an example helper function written in Pyrex,
      and (in docstring) link to wiki page about our use of Pyrex
      
  extensions.py 
      calls the pyrex_test extension module, assuming that got compiled from 
      its .pyx source file into its .so (or .dll or .dylib?) dynamic library file; 
      reports import errors, and in future might try to verify the extension module
      is up-to-date, and handle all our custom extension modules in a uniform way.
      (No pure python file can be named pyrex_test.py, since "import pyrex_test" would
      then not know whether to import the pure python module or the extension module.)

  setup.py (for distutils; configures compiling of all Python extensions from their source files)

  Makefile (has new "pyx" and/or "extensions" targets)

Files produced by building Pyrex extensions:

  pyrex_test.* (produced when Pyrex compiles this file; suffixes vary by platform, on the Mac they're .c and .so)

  build/   (subdirectory)

How to build:

  in cad/src, "make pyx"

How to test:

  see docstring of extensions.py
