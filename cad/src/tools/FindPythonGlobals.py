  FindPythonGlobals.py

  This is a standalone program for static analysis of python source
  files.  For each file given as an argument, it writes a list of all
  of the global symbols defined by the file, each accompanied by the
  name of the file.  The resulting list can be sorted and used to
  locate a source file given a symbol name.  Symbols which are defined
  in multiple files can be identified as well.

  The program relies on the internal python parser.  As such, it must
  be targeted to a specific version of python.  The initial code was
  written for the python2.5 parser.  Even a small change to the python
  grammar could change the way symbols in the parse tree need to be
  handled.  Turning on the verbose flag prints the complete parse tree
  of the input file, which can be used to determine how to search the
  tree for global definitions.

  To find global symbols, the search routine looks at top level
  statements, and inside of if, for, while, and try statements,
  recursively.  Within these contexts, it looks for def and class
  statements (which it does not look inside of).  It also looks for
  expressions of the form "NAME = ...".

  Note: this will not find globals defined in assignments with
  multiple =, like "a = b = False".  The global b would be missed
  in this case.
