make_gl_imports.py - make import statements for OpenGL identifiers,
which look like:

  from OpenGL.GL import GL_MODELVIEW_MATRIX
  from OpenGL.GLU import gluUnProject

@author: Bruce
@version: $Id: make_gl_imports.py 14222 2008-09-12 23:53:16Z brucesmith $
@copyright: 2008 Nanorex, Inc.  See LICENSE file for details.

Algorithm:

tokenize the input, and for each unique identifier
matching gl* or GL*, make an import statement based on its initial
characters, handling gl vs glu appropriately.

BUGS:

It thinks identifiers in import statements are in code,
so it will never remove imports when run on an entire file,
and it can get confused and suggest unnecessary ones
such as "from OpenGL.GL import GL" (from seeing the "GL"
in "OpenGL.GL" in an existing import statement).

It doesn't verify the symbol is available in the module
it proposes to import, so it will get confused by local
variables that start with 'gl' or classnames that
start with 'GL' (e.g. "GLPane"), for example.

TODO:

generalize to a tool which fixes up all toplevel imports
after you move some code around among several files,
by copying or moving imports to new files as needed,
and removing old ones, and warning if anything suspicious
might need manual checking (like a runtime import).
