# NFRs for packageDependency.py: @@@


# unrecognized modules should be classified as alone in a package,
# so they are very visible in the graph
# and so the arcs you see help you classify them properly.


# classification can be "layer|topic", e.g. "model|GAMESS",
# with options to use either or both parts (before/after the '|') as part of the package name;
# if no "|" then assume it's just the layer;
# the layers are what we have now (ui, model, etc)
# but note that in the current table [bruce 071217 2pm] I've also used ui/whatever in the layer
# in an experimental way re finer layer divisions.
#
# layer = general type of code;
# topic = topic of feature re user point of view (ie "which plugin it would be part of")
#
# interaction with colors: just use the layer in the color table, i think.
# (at least do that if the whole thing, layer|topic, is not listed there;
#  might fall back to topic for color lookup if necessary)
#
# interaction with good/bad arcs (packageLevel): ideally we have a separate table of levels
# for layer and topic, and each one is a partial order or specific DAG.
# But for now, numerical scheme only makes sense for layer, not for topic, so just use layer for this.


# lower priority: warnings based on the "disallowed" tables below
"""

# disallowed names

# NIM: warn or enforce the non-use of the following names (case-insensitively?)
# We don't list every possible disallowed name,
# just the ones that we might be tempted to use otherwise.
#
# Note: on Mac, python import seems to be case-sensitive even though you can't
# have two filesystem-directory entries differing only by case.
#
# If we can rely
# on this, we can change the rules which use the names below to permit a package
# named opengl, even though OpenGL is an extension module.

# Unfortunately, we'd still have
# to rule out a toplevel package named Build, since build is a reserved
# directory name -- import might not be confused, but the code which wants
# to locally create and use the "build" subdirectory would be.

# Package names we can't use at the top level:
disallowedToplevelPackageNames = {
    "build"        : "temporary directory for compiling some .pyx files", # can this be renamed? (see setup*.py or extensions.py)
    "ui"           : "name of subdirectory for icons/images", # should be renamed, but hard to do
    "main"         : "reserved for main.py",
}

# ===

# status of packageMapping as of 071210:

# virtual packages named below but not yet listed above:
# "?" - unclassified [maybe none at present]
# "operation" - tentative, for ops on model, could be model or controller
# "tools"

# names of existing Python packages (in theory all should appear above)
# - appearing above: exprs, PM, utilities, model
# - not yet appearing above: startup, dna_model, dna_updater, gui

# modules listed below but no longer output at toplevel by AllPyFiles.sh:
#   assembly - now in model/
#   whatsthis - now in gui/



# plans for specific classifications:

# ne1 package, for overall layout of ne1, as opposed some other app made from same pieces incl ui pieces
# (eg a small app for testing or script-running)

# simulation or analysis package, subdirs for GROMACS, GAMESS, ND-1(?), general? runsim too. some io code not separated.
# replaces some "operations" classifications; essentially a type of ops and io combined.
# levels: sim over ops over model, but we expect arcs in all directions in there, for now.


# update, 071217 2pm:
# the layer|topic is only used in a few entries; the others are "layer" with topic mentioned in the comment.
# look for @@@ to see a few things to review, and the place i got to in my overall scan.
# when done i need to review all at once the "simulation", *mode*, "ui", and *dialog entries.

    # partly since some of them need too much refactoring for that
    # to make sense just yet, and partly since I don't know them well,
    # and Mark is presently doing some refactoring within them.
    # The only exception is ne1_ui/help, which may not be complete,
    # but seems obvious enough and worth doing.
