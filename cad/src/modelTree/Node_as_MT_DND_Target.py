History:

Bruce 071025 moved these methods from class Node
and class ClipboardShelfGroup (where I'd written them long ago)
into this new controller class, to remove an import from class Node
to ops_copy. I left behind only a new Node API method this needs
to call, drop_on_should_autogroup.

TODO:

- drop_under is not finished or called (for drop between nodes)

- this uses 3 different ways of asking whether something is a Group!

- there's a longstanding request to revise the position under a group
into which a node gets dropped (from new last child to new first child,
I think). It has a bug number. One motivation is that there is some
place it's not possible to drop a node unless this is revised,
described in the bug report.
