Module classification: [bruce 071215]

At least foundation, due to integral use of "from changes import UsageTracker".
But also could be construed to have lots of app-specific knowledge,
due to "from prefs_constants import prefs_table". But for now, experiment
with pretending that's not app-specific, which we can get away with since
it's pure data... and this might even make sense, if different apps
share code which references the same prefs_keys from that table,
as long as we make sure they can use different (per-app) prefs files.
(For the same reason, we'll also classify prefs_constants as foundation
or lower. In fact, it'll be utilities or constants for now, as explained
in its docstring.)

A desirable refactoring might be to classify prefs_constants higher
(model or a specific app) and pass it to a prefs singleton as an argument.
Then it'd be more clearly ok to call this module "foundation", but let
prefs_constants be higher. OTOH, the reason explained above may make it
perfectly ok for prefs_constants to be very low.

==

Prototype for Alpha.

See lower-down docstrings for usage.

==

History:

bruce 050106 or so: created it.

[some minor changes since then]

bruce 050804: added prefs usage/change tracking.

==

Should be used with bsddb,
but works without it too, after printing a warning.
The module bsddb is present in our standard installations
of windows and linux python, but not yet Mac python;
but we can add it, since it's easily available from

  http://undefined.org/python/pimp/darwin-7.0.0-Power_Macintosh.html

(package bsddb3 4.1.6)

BUT WE SHOULD LOOK INTO THE LICENSE TO MAKE SURE IT'S OK!
(It probably is, and [050804] I think Huaicai investigated this
 and confirmed that it is.)

"""
Some internal & client-code documentation, as of 050106:

We store prefs in a shelf. Restrictions imposed by the shelve module:
Keys must be strings, values can be any pickleable python exprs,
and neither can be extremely long (exact limits are not made clear).

When these restrictions become a problem, we will make our intermediating
layer handle them (for example, by translating long keys to short ones).

==

Concurrent access:

We usually keep the shelf closed, in case other processes want to access or modify it too.
This only works if we assume that these processes only open it briefly when processing
some user event (typed command or clicked button), and this doesn't happen in two processes
at once since the user can only give events to one process at a time. For this reason,
it's important to only open it briefly during a user event (and only at the beginning
if the processing takes a long time), and never any other time!

Also, if you (a process) start another process which might access the prefs when it starts,
you should only access them yourself just before it starts (and during subsequent user events,
assuming that subprocess follows the same rule).

We rely on the client code to follow these rules; we don't try to enforce them.
Breaking them might conceivably trash the entire prefs database, or perhaps more likely,
cause an error in the process trying to access it while another process is doing so.
(This depends on the db module, and I don't know what bsddb does in this case.)

We make no attempt yet to handle these errors or back up the prefs database.

==

Internal shelf key usage:

Current internal shelf key usage (this might change at any time,
without the client-code keys changing):

Keys starting "k " are translated versions of client-code keys;
see internal _attr2key method (which will be renamed).

Keys starting '_' or with a digit are reserved for use by this code.
In fact, all other keys are reserved. Presently used: see the code.
The most important one is _format_version.

==

High-level keys and values:

Keys supplied by client code (translated through _attr2key into shelf keys)
are presently just strings, using conventions still mostly to be invented,
but in the future will be able to be more kinds of objects.

Values supplied by client code will in the future be translated, and have
metainfo added, but this is not yet done. Values must be pickleable, and
also should not include instances of classes until we decide which of
those are ok. (But Numeric arrays are ok.)

For now, all modules use the same global namespace of high-level keys,
but this might change. To permit this, the module defining the key
needs to be detectable by this code... basically this means any given key
should be passed into this module from the same external module.
Details to be documented when they are implemented and become relevant.

==

Usage by client code (for now -- this might change!):

  from foundation.preferences import prefs_context
  
  prefs = prefs_context()
  
  key = "some string" # naming conventions to be introduced later
  
  prefs[key] = value
  
  value = prefs[key] # raises KeyError if not there
  
  # these dict-like operations might or might not work
  # (not yet tested; someday we will probably suppport them
  # and make them more efficient than individual operations
  # when several prefs are changed at once)
  
  prefs.get(key, defaultvalue)
  
  prefs.update(dict1)
  
  dict1.update(prefs)
