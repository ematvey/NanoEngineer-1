Where is _copyOfObject (etc) documented? (In code and on wiki?)

That should say:

- When defining _copyOfObject, consider:

  - is it correct for any copyfunc argument? (esp in its assumption
    about what that returns, original or copy or transformed copy)
  
  - is its own return value __eq__ to the original? It should be,
    so you have to define __eq__ AND __ne__ accordingly.
  
  - should you define _s_scan_children to, to scan the same things copied?
    (Only if they are instance objects, and are "children".
     See S_CHILDREN doc for what that means.)

I did the above for VQT and jigs_planes, but still no __eq__ or children
for jig_Gamess -- I'll let that be a known bug I fix later,
to test the behavior of my error detect/response code.
[later: I think this ended up getting done.]
Also, when I do fix it (requires analyzing jig_Gamess contents)
I might as well turn it into using a mixin
to give it a proper __eq__ based on declaring the state attrs!

I might as well put state decls into the archived-state objects I'm creating,
so they too could be compared by __eq__ and diffed!!! (Actually, that wouldn't
work for diff since it has to descend into their dictionaries in an intelligent
way. But it might work for __eq__.)

This means my archived-state objects should really be objects, not just
tuples or dicts. Let's change the code that collects one to make this true.
Search for... attrdict?

S_CHILDREN: we might need a decl that we (some class) have no children
(so we don't print a warning about that), and a registration for external classes
of the same thing. [TODO: this needs a better explanation]

And certainly we need to go through the existing stateholder classes (e.g. Node)
and add their attr/child decls. [that has been done]
Maybe rather than accomodating copyable_attrs, we'll just replace it?
Not sure, maybe later (a lot of things use it). [it's still there, 071113]

Do any inappropriate objects get a key (like data or foreign objs)
in current code?? #####@@@@@

    """
    For efficiency, any classes defining __getattr__ which might frequently
    be compared using == or != or coerced to a boolean, should have definitions
    for __eq__ and __ne__ and __nonzero__ (and any others we forgot??),
    even if those are semantically equivalent to Python's behavior when they don't.

    Otherwise Python has to call __getattr__ on each comparison of these objects,
    just to check whether they have one of those special method definitions
    (potentially as a value returned by __getattr__). This makes those simple
    comparisons MUCH SLOWER!
    
    This mixin class is one way of solving that problem by providing definitions
    for those methods.

    It's ok for a subclass to override some of the methods defined here.
    It can override both __eq__ and __ne__, or __eq__ alone (which will cause
    our __ne__ to follow suit, since it calls the instances __eq__), but it
    should not normally override __ne__ alone, since that would probably
    cause __eq__ and __ne__ to be incompatible.

    These definitions are suitable for objects meant as containers for "named"
    mutable state (for which different objects are never equal, even if their
    *current* state is equal, since their future state might not be equal).

    They are not suitable for data-like objects. This is why the class name
    contains '_eq_id_' rather than '_eq_data_'. For datalike objects, there is
    no shortcut to defining each of these methods in a customized way (and that
    should definitely be done, for efficiency, under the same conditions in
    which use of this mixin is recommended). (We might still decide to make
    an _eq_data_mixin_(?) class for them, for some other reason.)

    General transitive closure routine using dictionaries for collections in its API,
    where the keys can be whatever you want as long as they are unique (for desired equiv classes of objects)
    and used consistently.
       Details: Toscan should be a dictionary whose values are the starting point for the closure,
    and collector(obj1, dict1) should take one such value obj1 (never passed to it before)
    and for each obj it finds from obj1 (in whatever way it wants -- that defines the relation we're transitively closing),

       We don't modify toscan, and we return a new dictionary (with consistent keys) whose values
    are all the objects we found. Collector will have been called exactly once on each object we return.
    It must not modify toscan (since we use itervalues on it while calling collector),
    at least when it was called on one of the values in toscan.
       If pass_counter = True, then pass collector a third argument, counter,

    3 for the new values found connected to *those*, etc.

    it can know the counter value it would be passed (same as the last stored one).
    If it wants to store the set of values, it can know we won't modify it, but it must not

##e Do we need a copier function for a Qt event? Probably not, since they're only safe
# to store after making copies (see comments around QMouseEvent in selectMode.py circa 060220),
# and (by convention) those copies are treated as immutable.

# The reason we can't use the standard Python copy module's deepcopy function:
# it doesn't give us enough control over what it does to instances of unrecognized classes.
# For our own classes, we could do anything, but for other classes, we need them to be copied
# as the identity (i.e. as unaggressively as possible), or perhaps signalled as errors or warnings,
# but copy.deepcopy would copy everything inside them, i.e. copy them as aggressively as possible,
# and there appears to be no way around this.

        This method is declared private solely for performance
        reasons.  In particular, InvalMixin.__getattr__() has a fast
        return for attributes which start with an underscore.  Many
        objects (like atoms) inherit from InvalMixin, and looking up
        non-existent attributes on them takes significantly longer if
        the attribute name does not start with underscore.  In

        exception processing overhead in copy_InstanceType(), so it
