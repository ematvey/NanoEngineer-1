# [comment during development:]
# We'll still try to fit into the varid/vers scheme for multiple
# out of order undo/redo, since we think this is highly desirable
# for A7 at least for per-part Undo. But varids are only needed
# for highlevel things with separate ops offered.
# So a diff is just a varid-ver list and a separate operation...
# which can ref shared checkpoints if useful. It can ref both
# cps and do the diff lazily if you want. It's an object,
# which can reveal these things... it has facets... all the
# same needs come up again... maybe it's easier to let the facets
# be flyweight and ref shared larger pieces and just remake themselves?

class Checkpoint:
    """
    Represents a slot to be filled (usually long after object is first created)
    with a snapshot of the model's undoable state. API permits snapshot data (self.state) to be
    filled in later, or (if implem supports) defined by a diff from the state of another checkpoint.

    Some things done in the calling code (esp. fill_checkpoint) will probably be moved into methods of this class eventually.

    Self.state will not exist until the state-data is fully defined (unless a future revision supports its being
    some sort of lazily-valued expr which indicates a lazily filled diff and a prior checkpoint).

    Self.complete is a boolean which is True once the snapshot contents are fully defined. As of 060118 this is
    the same as hasattr(self, 'state'), but if self.state can be lazy then it might exist with self.complete still being false.

    The main varid_ver might exist right away, but the ones that depend on the difference with prior state won't exist
    until the set of differences is known.

    Note: it is good to avoid letting a checkpoint contain a reference to its assy or archive or actual model objects,

    """
    Register <func> to be called on 2 args (archive, assy) every time some AssyUndoArchive mashes some
    saved state into the live objects of the current state (using setattr) and needs to fix things that might
    have been messed up by that or might no longer be consistent.
       The optional arguments <updates> and <after_update_of> affect the order in which the registered funcs
    are run, as described below. If not given for some func, its order relative to the others is arbitrary
    (and there is no way for the others to ask to come before or after it, even if they use those args).
       The ordering works as follows: to "fully update an attr" means that Undo has done everything it might
    need to do to make the values (and presence or absense) of that attr correct, in all current objects of
    that attr's class (including objects Undo needs to create as part of an Undo or Redo operation).
       The things it might need to do are, in order: its own setattrs (or delattrs?? ###k) on that attr;
    that class's _undo_update function; and any <funcs> registered with this function (register_undo_updater)
    which list that attr or its class(??) in their optional <updates> argument (whose syntax is described below).
       That defines the work Undo needs to do, and some of the ordering requirements on that work. The only other
    requirement is that each registered <func> which listed some attrs or classes in its optional
    <after_update_of> argument can't be run until those attrs or classes have been fully updated.
    (To "fully update a class", listed in <after_update_of>, means to update every attr in it which has been
    declared to Undo, except any attrs listed individually in the <updates> argument. [###k not sure this is right or practical])
       (If these requirements introduce a circularity, that's a fatal error we'll detect at runtime.)
       The syntax of <updates> and <after_update_of> is a sequence of classes, classnames, or "classname.attrname"
    strings. (Attrname strings can't be given without classnames, even if only one class has a declared attribute
    of that name.)
       Classnames don't include module names (except for builtin objects whose __class__._name__ includes them).
    All classes of the same name are considered equivalent. (As of 060223 the system isn't designed
    to support multiple classes of the same name, but it won't do anything to stop you from trying. In the future
    we might add explicit support for runtime reloading of classes and upgrading of their instances to the new versions
    of the same classes.)
       Certain classes have nicknames (like 'Chunk' for class molecule,
    before it was renamed) which can be used here because they've been
    specifically registered as permitted, using register_class_nickname.
       [This docstring was written before the code was, and when only one <func> was being registered so far,

     At most times, we have one complete ('filled') checkpoint, and a subsequent incomplete one (subject to being modified

     Even right after an undo or redo, we'll have a checkpoint
    that we just forced the model to agree with, and another one to hold whatever changes the user might make next
    (if they do anything other than another immediate undo or redo). (Hopefully we'll know whether that other one has
