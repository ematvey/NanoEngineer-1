Utility.py -- class Node (superclass for all model-tree objects),
Group [now defined in Group.py, no longer imported here],
and a few related classes or functions, defining a uniform
API to permit all Node subclasses to be shown in the model tree,
and methods for manipulation of Node trees. (Most Node subclasses
are defined in other files. Notable ones are molecule and Jig.)

(Note: all non-leaf nodes in a node tree must be instances of Group.)

See also: class Node_api in modelTreeGui.py (which is only the part
of the API needed by the ModelTree).

History:

Originally by Josh; gradually has been greatly extended by Bruce,
but the basic structure of Nodes and Groups has not been changed.

Bruce 071110 split Group.py out of Utility.py. (And may soon
split out Node and/or LeafNode as well.)

Bruce 080305 added some abstract classes between Node and Group
in the inheritance hierarchy (defined in this module for now).
