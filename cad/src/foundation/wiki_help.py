wiki_help.py -- associate webpages (typically in a wiki) with program features,

Module classification: [bruce 080101]

Mostly ui code, some io code; could be a subsystem of a general help system,
if we have one outside of ne1_ui.

Definitely doesn't belong in ne1_ui:
* not specific to NE1's individual UI
* imports nothing from ne1_ui
* imported by various things which ought to be lower than ne1_ui.

So, if we have a help module outside ne1_ui, put it there;
if we don't, it probably belongs in something like foundation.


Terminology note:

We use "web help" rather than "wiki help" in menu command text, since more users
will know what it means, and since nothing in principle forces the web pages
accessed this way to be wiki pages.

But we use "wiki help" in history messages, since we want people to think of
the wiki (rather than a rarely-changing web page) as an integral part of the
idea.

History:

idea from Eric D

will 051010 added wiki help feature to Mode classes

bruce 051130 revised it

bruce 051201 made new source file for it, extended it to other kinds of objects
(so far, some Node subclasses)
