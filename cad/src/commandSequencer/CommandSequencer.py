History:

Bruce 2004 or 2005: written (partly based on older code by Josh),
as class modeMixin in modes.py, mixin class for GLPane

Bruce 071009 split into its own file

Bruce 071030 file (but not class) renamed to CommandSequencer

Bruce 2008 made "not GLPANE_IS_COMMAND_SEQUENCER" work (not yet on by default)

Bruce 2008 (with Ninad working in other files) made USE_COMMAND_STACK work

Bruce 080909 class renamed from modeMixin to CommandSequencer

Bruce 080911 turned off GLPANE_IS_COMMAND_SEQUENCER by default

Bruce 080925 remove support for GLPANE_IS_COMMAND_SEQUENCER

Ninad 2008-09-26: Turned on USE_COMMAND_STACK by default; stripped out old code

[old comment:]
roughly: mode -> command or currentCommand, ...

    Controller/owner class for command stack and command switching behavior.

    (Each Assembly owns one of these. Before 080911/080925, it was instead
    a mixin of class GLPane.)
    
    External API for changing command stack (will be revised):
    to enter a given command:
    - userEnterCommand
    to exit a command (and perhaps then enter a specific new one):
    - command.command_Done, others
    other:
    - start_using_initial_mode
    - exit_all_commands
    
    Maintains instance attributes currentCommand, graphicsMode (deprecated
    to access it from here) (both read-only for public access), and mostly private
    attributes for access by command-sequencing code in class Command,
    such as nullmode and _commandTable.

    @note: graphicsMode is also available from GLPane, which gets it from here
           via its assy. Maybe it won't be needed from here at all... so we print
           a console warning whenever it's accessed directly from here.

    Public attributes available during calls of command.command_will_exit:
    
    exit_is_cancel -- whether this exit is caused by Cancel.

    exit_is_forced -- whether this exit is forced to occur (e.g. caused by
    exit_all_commands when closing a model).

    warn_about_abandoned_changes -- when exit_is_forced, whether the user should
    be warned about changes (if any) stored in active commands being exited
    (as opposed to changes stored in the model in assy, as usual) which are
    being discarded unavoidably

    exit_is_implicit -- whether this exit is occuring only as a prerequisite
    of entering some other command
    
    exit_target -- if not None, the goal of the exit is ultimately to exit
    the command of this commandName

    enter_target -- if not None, the goal of the exit is ultimately to enter
    the command of this commandName

        Call this near the end of __init__, and whenever the mode
        objects need to be remade.  Create new mode objects (one
        for each mode, ready to take over mouse-interaction

        the current assembly changes, since the mode objects store
        the current assembly in some menus they make. (At least
        that's one reason I noticed -- there might be more. None of
        this was documented before now.)  (#e Storing the current
        assembly in the modes might cause trouble, if our
        functionality is extended in certain ways; if we someday
        fix that, the mode objects could be retained for the
        lifetime of their command sequencer. But there's no reason we need to
        keep them longer, unless they store some other sort of
        state (like user preferences), which is probably also bad

        ### TODO: docstring needs merging into that of userEnterCommand
        """
        Public method, called from the UI when the user asks to enter
        a specific command (named by commandName), e.g. using a toolbutton
        or menu item. It can also be called inside commands which want to
        change to another command.

        The commandName argument can be a commandName string, e.g. 'DEPOSIT',
        or a symbolic name like '$DEFAULT_MODE', or [### VERIFY THIS]
        a command instance object. (Details of commandName, and all options,
        are documented in Command._f_userEnterCommand [### TODO: revise doc,
        since that method no longer exists].)

        If commandName is a command name string and we are already in that
        command, then do nothing unless always_update is true [new feature,
        080730; prior code did nothing except self._cseq_update_after_new_mode(),
        equivalent to passing always_update = True to new code].
        Note: all calls which pass always_update as of 080730 do so only
        to preserve old code behavior; passing it is probably not needed
        for most of them. [###REVIEW those calls]

        The current command has to exit (or be suspended) before the new one
        can be entered, but it's allowed to refuse to exit, and if it does
        exit it needs a chance to clean up first. So we let the current
        command implement this method and decide whether to honor the user's
        request. (If it doesn't, it should emit a message explaining why not.
        If it does, it should call the appropriate lower-level command-switching
        method [### TODO: doc what those are or where to find out].

        (If that raises an exception, we assume the current command has a bug
        and fall back to default behavior here.)

        TODO: The tool icons ought to visually indicate the current command,
        but for now this is done by ad-hoc code inside individual commands
        rather than in any uniform way. One defect of that scheme is that
        the code for each command has to know what UI buttons might invoke it;
        another is that it leads to that code assuming that a UI exists,
        complicating future scripting support. When this is improved, the
        updating of toolbutton status might be done by
        self._cseq_update_after_new_mode().
        [Note, that's now in GLPane but should probably move into this class.]
