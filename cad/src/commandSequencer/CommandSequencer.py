CommandSequencer.py - prototype (or stub) Command Sequencer.
For now, this is just class modeMixin, which acts as the
"Command Sequencer aspect of the GLPane"; this will either
be replaced by or evolve into a real Command Sequencer.

(Until we decide, I kept the old class name to avoid a false promise
of good design, but on 071030 gave it a new module name to
make the role in the current code clear.)

History:

- written by Bruce long ago, in modes.py, mixed into GLPane.py

- split into its own file, bruce 071009

- file (but not class) renamed to CommandSequencer, bruce 071030

TODO:

roughly: mode -> command or currentCommand, prevMode -> _prevCommand or worse,
glpane -> commandSequencer; and then on to real refactoring. Also, some of the
logic in basicMode is really part of the command sequencer (which basicMode
should just interface to rather than "try to be").

        Call this near the end of __init__, and whenever the mode
        objects need to be remade.  Create new mode objects (one
        for each mode, ready to take over mouse-interaction
        whenever that mode is in effect).

        [As of 050911, leave self.mode as nullmode, not the default mode.]

        We redo this whenever
        the current assembly changes, since the mode objects store
        the current assembly in some menus they make. (At least
        that's one reason I noticed -- there might be more. None of
        this was documented before now.)  (#e Storing the current
        assembly in the modes might cause trouble, if our
        functionality is extended in certain ways; if we someday
        fix that, the mode objects could be retained for the
        lifetime of their command sequencer. But there's no reason we need to
        keep them longer, unless they store some other sort of
        state (like user preferences), which is probably also bad
        for them to do. So we can ignore this for now.)

        TODO: The tool icons ought to visually indicate the current command,
        but for now this is done by ad-hoc code inside individual commands
        rather than in any uniform way. One defect of that scheme is that
        the code for each command has to know what UI buttons might invoke it;
        another is that it leads to that code assuming that a UI exists,
        complicating future scripting support. When this is improved, the
