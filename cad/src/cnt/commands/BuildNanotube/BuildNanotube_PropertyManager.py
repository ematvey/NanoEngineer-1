Ninad 2008-01-11: Created


TODO: as of 2008-01-11
- Needs more documentation and the file is subjected to heavy revision. 
This is an initial implementation of default Cnt edit mode.
- Methods such as callback_addSegments might be renamed.
- DEPRECATE THE self.sequenceEditor. (that code has been commented out) 
   see a comment in self,__init__
BUGS:
- Has bugs such as -- Flyout toolbar doesn't get updated when you return to 
  BuildNanotube_EditCommand from a a temporary command. 
- Just entering and leaving BuildNanotube_EditCommand creates an empty NanotubeGroup
