Graphics mode intended to be used while in NanotubeSegment_EditCommand.
While in this command, user can
(a) Highlight and then left drag the resize handles located at the
    two 'axis endpoints' of thje segment to change its length.
(b) Highlight and then left drag any axis atom (except the two end axis atoms)
    to translate the  whole segment along the axis
(c) Highlight and then left drag any strand atom to rotate the segment around
    its axis.

    Note that implementation b and c may change slightly if we implement special
    handles to do these oprations.

History:
Created 2008-03-10 from copy of DnaSegment_GraphicsMode.py
Recreated 2008-04-02 from copy of DnaSegment_GraphicsMode.py

TODO: as of 2008-02-01: (original list from DnaSegment_GraphicsMode.py)
- This graphics mode uses some duplicated code from Move_GraphicsMode
(for rotating or translating about own axis .. its a small portion and simpler
to understand) and also from DnaLine_GM (mainly the drawing code).
Ideally, it should switch to these graphics modes while remaining in the same
command (using command.switchGraphicsModeTo method) But it poses problems.
Issues related to use of DnaLine_GM are mentioned in DnaSegment_EditCommand.
In future, we may need to incorporate more functionality from these graphics
modes so this should be refactored then.

- Need to review methods in self.leftDrag and self.leftDown ..there might be
 some bugs...not sure.
