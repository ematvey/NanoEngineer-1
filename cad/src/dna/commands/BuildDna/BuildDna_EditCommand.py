TODO: as of 2008-01-11
- Needs more documentation and the file is subjected to heavy revision.
This is an initial implementation of default Dna edit mode.
- Methods such as callback_addSegments might be renamed.
BUGS:
- Has bugs such as -- Flyout toolbar doesn't get updated when you return to
  BuildDna_EditCommand from a a temporary command.
- Just entering and leaving BuilddDna_EditCommand creates an empty DnaGroup
