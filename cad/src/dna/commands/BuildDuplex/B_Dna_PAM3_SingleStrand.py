History:
Created on 2008-04-02

TODO as of 2008-04-07
- add more documentation. may undergo major refactoring/renaming changes.
- post FNANO allow resizing of a single strand such that: if axis atoms
on original dna match with the ones on the newly created single stranded dna,
delete those atoms and fuse the bare strand with existing atoms
- May be revise the dna creation process thoughout. Example, see how to generate
 positions of strand-axis atoms without using the old way of inserting bases from
 mmp and performing transforms on them.
- move this file to dna/model
- Methods such as the following need REVIEW post FNANO08 (not urgent). May be
 revise algorithm for optimization or supporting some features such as
 'extend and bond

        Figure B:
        Lets assume that we extend strand (2) by 4 bases. So,
        the new dna that we will create in self.modify() is indicated by the
        strand (2) with symbols 'X' for strand base atoms and symbol 'o' for
        the axis base atoms. Clearly, the axis atoms 'o' overlap the axis atoms
        of the original dna. So we will remove those. As a result of this
        replacement, strand atoms 'X' will be without any axis atoms , so we
        will bond them with the original axis atoms '*'. The overall result is
        the original duplex's strand 2 gets extended by 4 bases and it still
        remains connected with the corresponding bases in strand (1) (the
        complementary strand )

        TODO:
         - method needs to be renamed The original dna may be a single stranded
        dna or a duplex. Until 2008-04-02 ,it was possible to create or modify
        only a duplex and thats why the name 'duplex'
        -  Refactor further. May be use superclass method with some mods.
