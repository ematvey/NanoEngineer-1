TODO: as of 2008-02-14
- Attributes such as height_ref need to be renamed. But this should really be done
  in the superclass exprs.DraggableHandle_AlongLine. 
- Needs refactoring. Shares common things with DnaSegment_ResizeHandle . 
  Really the only difference is the handle appearance. See if renaming 
  DnaSegment_ResizeHandle and then using it as a common class makes sense.
