History:

Jeff 2007-06-13 (created)
  - Transfered class Dna, A_Dna, A_Dna_PAM5, B_Dna, B_Dna_PAM5, 
    Z_Dna abd Z_Dna_PAM5 from Will Ware's DNAGenerator.py.
  - Added accessor methods getBaseRise/setBaseRise
  
Mark 2007-08-17:
  - make() creates a duplex structure only (no single strands).
  - Created standard directory structure for DNA MMP files.
  - PAM5 MMP files reworked and simplfied.
  - A single PAM5 base-pair duplex is made correctly.
  - Moved Dna constants to Dna_Constants.py. 
  - Changed default base to "X" (unassigned) from "N" (aNy base).
  - Implemented Standard IUB Codes (see Dna_Constants.py)

Mark 2007-10-18: 
- Did a major rewrite of this module, superseding it --
  DnaDuplex.py.

Bruce 2008-1-1:
- renamed this from Dna.py to DnaGenHelper.py so it's
  not in a way of a proposed "dna" package.
