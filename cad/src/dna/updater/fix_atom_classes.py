##issues: bondpoint classes. need a separate func to fix them later?
##which ones do we fix, all new bps and all bps on changed atoms? (yes)
##for all these, fix all bps on on base at once, so store base in a dict
##after all transmutes and breaks.
##
##other issues:
##    Atom vs ChemAtom
##    code on Atom or on Element?
##    or Atomtype?
##
##guess: as we fix atoms colect bps and their base atoms into sep dict
##when it's full, incl of busted bonds,
##then fix all the bps of those base atoms.
##using a separate func, to fix bp classes and reposition them too.
##
##so this present code can ignore bps for now.
