    # For phase 1:
    #
    # Loop over strand's base atoms, watching the strand join and leave
    # axis chains and move along them. If it jumps (moves more than one base)
    # or stays on the same atom (implying that it switched ladder sides --
    #  not physically realistic, but we can't depend on it never happening),
    # pretend that it left the axis and rejoined it. Leaving the axis
    # (pretend or really) breaks the strand there (in terms of which ladder
    # rail it will end up in) and breaks the axis after the leaving point
    # (or on both sides of that axis atom, if we didn't yet know the
    #  direction of travel of the strand along the axis, since we just
    #  entered the axis). Joining an axis breaks that axis before that
    #  point, relative to the direction we'll travel in, so record this
    #  and break the axis as we start to travel.
    #
    # The only other case is if we just change directions, i.e. we hit axis
    # atoms A, B, A. (This is not physically realistic, if only due to the
    #  implied base stacking, but we can't depend on it not happening.)
    # This implies we changed sides of the axis (from one ladder rail to
    # the other), but we don't know if that was before or after B, so we
    # pretend we left and rejoined both before and after B. (In fact,
    # since either leaving or joining requires a break, maybe both these
    # breaks are always required. If not, extra breaks at this stage are ok,
    # since they'll be fixed later when we merge ladders.)
    #
    # In more detail: in case we switched after B in that A B A sequence,
    # do whatever a jump after B would do (no special case required).
    # In case we switched sides before B, we wish we'd done a jump at the
    # prior step, but we know enough now (in the step when we detect this)
    # to do all the same things that would do, so do them now.
    #
    # About rings -- we could be aware of ring index circular order,
    # but we want rings in ladders to be "aligned" in terms of indexes
    # in those ladders (one index for all 3 atoms on one ladder rung),
    # so the easiest way to ensure that is just to pretend rings are
    # chains at this stage (for both strand and axis rings), and break
    # strands whereever they go around the ring (jumping from end to
    # start). This means we should just ignore ring index circularity.
    #
    # (We may or may not patch this later by noticing which ladders are
    # whole rings... since moebius rings are possible, or partial rings
    # (axis rail is ring, strand rail is not), it's probably best to
    # ignore this on ladders and just follow the individual chains as
    # needed.)
    
    # To get started, we're in the state of having left some axis
    # (all done with it) and about to enter a new one. The loop body
    # can't know that, so record an impossible value of which axis
    # we're in. In general, the loop variables need to know which
    # axis we were in, where we were, and which way we were going
    # or that we just entered it, with a special case for having
    # been in no axis or having been all done with the prior axis.
