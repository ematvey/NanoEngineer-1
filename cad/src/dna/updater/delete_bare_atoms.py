    Delete excessively-bare atoms (defined as axis atoms without strand atoms,
     or any other PAM atoms that are not allowed to exist with as few neighbors
     as they have -- note that the rules for strand atoms are in flux as of
     080117 since the representation of single-stranded DNA is as well).

    # Q. Which changes recorded by our side effects are needed in subsequent
    # dna updater steps?
    # A. The changed neighbor atoms are needed, in case they're the only
    # indicator of a change to the chain they're on (especially if the killed
    # atom was in a different dna ladder). But their classes needn't be changed,
    # and their deletion can't cause any more atoms to become bare (due to
    # the current meaning of bare), so no earlier updater steps need to be
    # repeated.

    # Note: if these debug prefs are not both True, errors might occur in the
    # dna updater. The goal is for these errors to be harmless (just debug
    # prints). As of 071205 the defaults are True, False, respectively.

    # refrain from killing a bare atom (giving a count, per PAM model).
