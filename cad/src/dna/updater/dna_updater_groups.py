    @param new_chunks: list of all newly made DnaLadderRailChunks (or modified
                       ones, if that's ever possible)

    @param new_wholechains: list of all newly made WholeChains (or modified

    Make sure that PAM chunks and jigs are inside the correct
    Groups of the correct structure and classes, according to
    the DNA Data Model. These Groups include Groups (which someday
    might be called Blocks in this context), DnaSegments,
    DnaStrands, and DnaGroups. Move nodes or create new groups
    of these kinds, as needed.

    Since the user can't directly modify the insides of a DnaGroup,
    and the maintaining code can be assumed to follow the rules,
    the main focus here is on newly created objects, made by
    old code or by reading old mmp files which don't already
    have them inside the right groups.

    For reading mmp files (old or new) to work smoothly, we may [###decide this! it may already sort of work for chunks...]
    also ask the lower-level code that runs before this point
    to add new chunks into the model next to some older chunk
    that contained one of its atoms (if there was one),
    so that if the old chunk was already in the right place,
    the new one will be too.

    We may also convert existing plain Groups into DnaGroups
    under some circumstances, but this is NIM to start with,
    and may never be worth doing, since some touchups of
    converted old files will always be required. But at least,
    if converted files contain useless singleton Groups
    around newly made DnaGroups, we might discard them except
    for copying their name down (which is essentially the same
    thing).

    # a chunk or marker out of, or a Block that we delete all the contents of,

    # all as having new per-atom errors), or an ordinary group that contained
    # ordinary chunks of PAM DNA, or an ordinary group that contained a DnaGroup
    # we'll delete here.
    #
    # In some of these cases, if the group has become
    # completely empty we should delete it. In theory we should ask the group

    # for a Block, probably not for an ordinary group, so for now,
    # never do this. (Before 080222 we might do this even for a
    # DnaSegment or DnaStrand, I think -- probably a bug.)

    #  original list we delete things from below, and only consider those
