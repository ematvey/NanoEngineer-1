    """
    Change atom's class to newclass.

    This might be done by directly replacing atom.__class__,
    or by making a new Atom instance (identical except for __class__)
    and replacing atom with newatom in the rest of the model (assy)
    in which atom resides, and in all transient state that might
    point to atom (accessible via atom's assy).

    If any atomdicts are passed, they are assumed to be
    atom.key -> atom dicts in which atom should be also replaced with
    newatom (at the same key, since it will be given the same .key).

    @param atom: a real atom or bondpoint of any subclass of Atom.
    @type atom: Atom.

    @param newclass: any subclass of Atom.
    @type newclass: class

    @param atomdicts: zero or more dicts which map atom.key to atom
                      (for any atom, not just the one passed)
                      and in which atom (the one passed)
                      should be replaced with newatom if necessary.
    @type atomdicts:  zero or more dictionaries.
    
    @return: None. (If newatom is needed, caller should get it
                   from one of the atomdicts.)

    # it's supported) and is much simpler and faster than the alternative.

    # (This is not a kluge, except to the extent that it might not be
    # officially supported. It's a well-defined concept (assuming the

    # in some languages, and does exactly what we want.)

    # If resetting __class__ ever stops working, we'll have to implement
    # this function in a much harder way: make a new Atom of the desired
    # class, and then replace atom with newatom everywhere it occurs,
    # both in the model and in all transient state -- in bonds, jigs,
    # chunks (including hotspot), part.selatoms, glpane.selobj/.selatom,
    # and any other state I'm forgetting or that gets added to the code.
    # (But I think we could get away without also replacing it in undo diffs
    # or the glname allocator, since the old atom won't have had a chance
    # to get into undo diffs by the time the dna_updater runs, or to get
    # drawn (so its glname won't matter yet).)

    # some of that work, and a more detailed comment about what would have
    # to be done, also covering analogous replacements for Bond and Chunk.
