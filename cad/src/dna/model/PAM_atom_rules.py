    """
    Are a1 and a2 both PAM atoms or bondpoints which are allowed in the same
    DnaLadder, during either formation or merging of ladders?
    
    If not, this might be for any reason we want, including cosmetic
    (e.g. chunk colors differ), but if different atoms in one base pair
    use different criteria, problems might ensue if the dna updater does not
    explicitly handle that somehow when forming ladders (since currently
    it requires all atoms in one full or partial basepair to be in one ladder).

    Presently, we allow bondpoints to go with anything; other than that,
    we require both atoms to have the same PAM model, and to be in chunks
    with the same PAM-related properties (display_as_pam, save_as_pam).
    """
    # BUG: the following will be wrong, if the atoms in one full or partial
    # basepair disagree about this data. To fix, find the basepair here
    # (if too big, mark atoms as error, use default results), and combine
    # the properties to make a joint effective property on each atom,
    # before comparing. Not trivial to do that efficiently. Or, actually
    # modify the atoms in a basepair to agree, or mark them as errors so
    # they are excluded from chains, at earlier updater stages. ### TODO
    #
    # I'm ignoring this for now, though it means some operation bugs could
    # lead to updater exceptions. (And correct operations must change these
    # properties in sync across base pairs.) It may even mean the user can
    # cause those errors by piecing together base pairs from different
    # DnaLadders using direct bond formation. (Maybe make rung-bond-former
    # detect and fix those?)
