    A ChainAtomMarker specialized for DNA axis or strand atoms
    (base atoms only, not Pl atoms).

    Abstract class; see subclasses DnaSegmentMarker and
    DnaStrandMarker.

    Description of how this object stays updated in various situations: ### UPDATE after details are coded @@@

    When read from an mmp file, or copied, it is valid but has no
    cached chain, etc... these will be added when the dna updater
    creates a new chain and ladder and one of these "takes over
    this marker". Part of that "takeover" is for self to record info
    so next_atom is not needed for understanding direction, or anything
    else about the chain self is presently on, since that chain might
    not be valid when self later needs to move along it.
    (This info consists of self's index (which rail and where) and direction
     in a DnaLadder.)

    After copy, in self.fixup_after_copy(), ... ### NIM; spelling? (check atom order then, and record info so next_atom not needed) @@@

    After Undo, our _undo_update method will arrange for equivalent
    checks or updates to be done... ### REVIEW, IMPLEM (also check atom order then, and record info so next_atom not needed) @@@

    If our marker atom dies, self.remove_atom() records this so the
    dna updater will move self to a new marker atom, and make sure
    the new (or preexisting) chain/ladder there takes over self. ### DOIT for preexisting -- can happen! @@@
    (We have a wholechain which can't be preexisting after we're moved,
     but our ladder and its ladder rail chain can be.)

    If our next_atom dies or becomes unbonded from our marker_atom,
    but our marker_atom remains alive, we can probably stay put but
    we might need a new direction indicator in place of next_atom.
    The dna updater handles this too, as a special case of "moving us".
        ### REVIEW, does it work? what call makes this happen? has to come out of changed_atoms, we might not be "homeless" @@@

    After any of these moves or other updates, our marker_atom and next_atom
    are updated to be sufficient when taken alone to specify our
    position and direction on a chain of atoms. This is so those attrs
    are the only ones needing declaration for undo/copy/save for that purpose.
    
    We also maintain internal "cached" attrs like our index within a ladder,
    for efficiency and to help us move when those atoms become killed or
    get changed in other ways.
    """
