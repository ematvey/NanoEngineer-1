Context: [warning: some of this info might be obs]

The PAM atoms in any PAM DNA structure will be internally divided into
"ladders", in which all the bonding strictly follows the pattern

 ...  -+-+-+-+-+-+-> ... (strand 1)
       | | | | | | 
 ...  -+-+-+-+-+-+-  ... (axis; missing for free-floating single strand)
       | | | | | | 
 ... <-+-+-+-+-+-+-  ... (strand 2; missing for any kind of single strand)

(with the strand bond directions antiparallel and standardized
to 1 on top (measured left to right == towards increasing baseatoms
index), -1 on bottom).

The dna updater will maintain these ladders, updating them
when their structure is changed. So a changed atom in a ladder will
either dissolve or fragment its ladder (or mark it for the updater to
do that when it next runs), and the updater, dealing with all changed
atoms, will scan all the atoms not in valid ladders to make them into
new ladders (merging new ladders end-to-end with old ones, when that's
valid, and whe they don't become too long to be handled efficiently).

A Dna Segment will therefore consist of a series of ladders (a new one
at every point along it where either strand has a nick or crossover,
or at other points to make it not too long). Each "ladder rail"
(one of the three horizontal atom-bond chains in the figure")
will probably be a separate Chunk, though the entire ladder should
have a single display list for efficiency (so its rung bonds are
in a display list) as soon as that's practical to implement.

So the roles for a ladder include:
- guide the dna updater in making new chunks
- have display code and a display list

A DnaLadder is not visible to copy or undo (i.e. it contains no
undoable state), and is not stored in the mmp file.

#  for now, assume just an object (not a Node), and try to fit it into
#  the copy & undo code in some other way... or I might decide it's entirely
#  implicit re them.) If that gets hard, make it a Group. (Where in the internal MT?
#  whereever the chunks would have been, without it.)
