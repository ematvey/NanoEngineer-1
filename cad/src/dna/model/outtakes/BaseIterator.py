BaseIterator.py - stub, not yet used -- probably superseded by

Plan:
- write this code as proto of marker move code, also can be used by user ops between updater runs
 (bfr they change stuff or after they change and run updater -- uses old info in between (that might be useful??)):
  - find ladder and index for an atom, via .molecule -- atom method
  - scan on these indices using rail.neighbor_baseatoms -- atom or ladder method? ladder is best i think.
    ### update: from one ladder to next, need to use wholechain, can't trust atom.molecule... can use ladders inside rails if useful
    but it might be more useful to use rails directly. ###decide
  maybe global helpers are good, or even a flyweight for doing the scan (can have attrs like ringQ, base index, etc).
  hmm, that flyweight base scanner could be used in dna sequence code (edit, write to file, etc),
  for this, for marker move... seems like a good idea.
  methods: 
  - make one from atom, or ladder/whichrail/whichbase
  - scan it both dirs
  - get things from it (as attrs or get methods)
  - ask it things like whether there's a nick or crossover? scan to next nick or crossover? etc

* obsolete scratch file outtakes/BasePair.py (might have some methodname ideas)
