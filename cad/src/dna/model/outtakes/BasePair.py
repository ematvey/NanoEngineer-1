BasePair.py - BasePair, StackedBasePairs flyweight objects

WARNING -- this is not yet used; it's really just a scratch file.
Furthermore, it will probably never be used, since the recognition
of base pairs by the dna updater will occur differently, but once
it's happened, the scanning of them can occur more efficiently
by using the already-recognized DnaLadders. So I'll probably move
it to outtakes soon. In fact, why not now? Ok, moving it now.
