        Returns the axis end atom of the 'currentStruct' of self's editCommand, 
        at the given position. 
        Example: 
        If there are 4 Dnasegments being resized at the same time, the two 
        resize handles will be at the average end positions. When you resize
        these segments using , for example , the right handle, it loops through 
        the individual segments to resize those. While doing these, it needs to
        know the resize end axis atom. How to get that information? In 
        self.updateAverageEndPoints() (which is called earlier), we create 
        two lists for each end. Example: all end1 points are in 
        self.endPoint_1_list (including their average end point which is 
        self.end1) . So in this routine, we determine which of the list to 
        use based on <position> (which is  either of the average end points 
        i.e. self.end1 or self.end2) and then check which of the endPoints
        of the editCommand's currentStruct lies in this list.
        
        @TODO: This method will be SLOW if there are large number of structures
        being edited at once (i.e. large self._structList) . Needs revision.

        We can't use a dictionary because dict.key cant be a Vector object 
        (example dict[key] != ([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])) see the disabled code that 
        tried to use has_key of dict. Need to come up with a better search
