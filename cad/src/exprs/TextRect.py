# Note: this uses fixed size for text on screen, regardless of depth -- we'll need to revise this someday. #e


# Plan: make this just good enough for use as a debugging tool -- e.g. to make instances that show their own ipath.
# It still uses utility funcs and an assumed-bound-texture from cad/src/drawtest.py.
