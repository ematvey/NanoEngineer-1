        #####@@@@@ need to decide whether we or the formula should do usage tracking and subscribe self.inval to what we use.
            # to decide -- what kinds of formulas can be ortho to kinds of invalidatable lvalues?
            # do we memo in formula or here? who decides? do we own formula? what does it have, other than ability to recompute?
            # how often is it made by FormulaFromCallable -- always? yes, ie in both _C_rule and _CV_rule (using LvalDict 1 or 2).
            # - The differentest kind of lval is the one for displists; it represents a pair of virtual values, the displist direct
            # contents and the effect of calling it (only the latter includes sublist effects), both represented by version numbers
            # which is what "diff old and new" would use. Instead of get_value we have emit_value i.e. draw. For inval propogation
            # it needs to separate the two virtual values. Maybe it could use two Lval objects.... [latest code for it is in NewInval.py]
            #   - It has to work with draw methods, which also emit side effects, have version numbers... do they, too,
            # distinguish between two virtual values, what OpenGL they emit vs what that will do when it runs??
            # - The other big issue is formulas with no storage of their own, and not owned. (E.g. those coded using _self.)
            #   - The biggest change in that is wanting to call its compute method with an arg, for use in grabbing attrs when evalling
            #     and for knowing where to store usage (tho latter could be in dynenv in usual way, and should be).
            # - Note that what I often call a formula is just an expr, and a formula instance is an expr instance, class InstanceOrExpr,
            # even if it's an OpExpr. That thing has its own memo, implemented by this class Lval. So all it provides us is a
            # compute method. This is suggesting that our _formula should be merely a compute method. Does that fit in displist case??
