These files are bits of code removed from parent directory files
and desirable to be kept around for the time being for purposes
of text searching by the developer, but are otherwise not meant
to be part of NE1. They should not be loaded into NE1 or processed by any code
parsing tools such as PyChecker.
They are not necessarily parseable.
