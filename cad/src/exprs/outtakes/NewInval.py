# env + expr -> understood expr (in that env), an obj with attrs (oresmic?)
# expr + env/place -> placed expr;
#   done by a recompute rule, so it might get invalidated, and it's an attrval which is itself usage tracked
# env is divided up - for us, expr interp rules, state (model, transient, optim, displists), glpane & its state and coords
#   and we might yet have to declare or divide it based on what changes rarely, per drawable instance, or per frame (affects inval code)

# write these funcs so that their api does not preclude them from memoizing, or force them to

# they can be env methods, since env determines how they all work and holds the memos

# subenv for every expr level as i interpret, if necessary, or is it just a sub-place?
# but it might only exist during interp -- it's parallel to, but perhaps more transient than, yet more general than,
# transient-state container-hierarchy

# do that code walkthough for a simple example - simple MT with displists (on paper)

# then sort that code into methods on objects, then classes, then write it down in this style.

# overall - recompute rule in drawing env, from expr to its implem (where to send draw events)
# uses understood expr, which tells flags about whether it uses transient state, class or constructorfunc for creating drawable...

# expr object - return the head, and arglist incl options or that there is none, and lexical class from parser if any

# expr in env - understand it, incl how to make it, then make it (in place) (I guess place != env, env is that part of place
#    which affects understanding of expr, maybe not including the part that has changing vars at runtime, or even changing opt vals)
#    (but the understanding might say "opt X has type T" and then that might be what decided the val was in the other place,
#     for env opt vals? not sure.)
