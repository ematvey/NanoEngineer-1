# I don't think Local and If can work until we get WEs to pass an env into their subexprs, as we know they need to do ####@@@@

# If will eval its cond in the env, and delegate to the right argument -- when needing to draw, or anything else
# Sensor is like Highlightable and Button code above
# Overlay is like Row with no offsetting
# Local will set up more in the env for its subexprs
# Will they be fed the env only as each method in them gets called? or by "pre-instantiation"?
