# Import order issues --
# This module basic gets imported first, and it will be imported at the beginning of most modules.
# But it wants to define things of general interest to all modules.
#
# This can lead to recursive import problems. Here is how we will resolve them:
# - If a high-level def should be included here, import it last.
#   Then when it imports basic, it will find what it needs already defined in basic.
# - When we import several high-level defs, they should be lowest-level first; higher ones will find lower ones
#   defined in basic when they import it, but not vice versa (but they shouldn't need to find them).
# - When we import symbols like Expr or define symbols like Arg, also do this in order of level, in terms of import dependency.
#
# Note that this means we can't put all our import statements first --
# we have to interleave them with local defs, based on level.
#
# Specific problems:
# - ExprsMeta knows about special cases for some symbols defined in modules which have to import ExprsMeta for its metaclass.
#   Solution: ExprsMeta should only import those special-case symbols at runtime.
#   (And it should do so using reload_once, so their own modules can support runtime reload.)
#
# Approximate order of imports:
# - Python and debug utilities (especially the ones needed by ExprsMeta), including those defined outside this exprs package
# - ExprsMeta (needed as a metaclass by many classes we'll define)
# - abstract classes like Expr and InstanceOrExpr
# - widget classes, in order of lowest to highest level (most of them don't need to be imported by this module at all)
