# WARNING: the reload feature implemented herein has become broken, probably
# ever since the confirmation corner started importing exprs modules without
# using reload_once. Its calls were then significantly modified when import *
# was removed from exprs, which may have further broken it, but this is
# unknown. It should be considered dead until it can be analyzed and fixed,
# or preferably, replaced with a better feature. The above init of ENABLE_RELOAD
# is safe enough for now, since it only sets it when ATOM_DEBUG is turned on
# before this module is first imported (probably at startup due to confirmation
# corner imports of other exprs modules -- not sure). [bruce 070829 comment]

    This function is used to support automatic runtime reloading of modules
    within this package, for developer convenience. To use it, add this code
    before any import of symbols from a module (or use this code in place of
    any direct import of a module):

    #  import module
    #  reload_once(module)

    Warning: not all modules support runtime reload. Those that don't should
    say so in their docstrings.
    
    Warning: this system does not yet properly handle indirect imports, when
    only the inner module has been modified. See code comments for details,
    especially the docstring of debug.reload_once_per_event(). As a workaround,
    if A imports B and you edit B.py, also edit A.py in order to trigger the
    desired runtime reload of B.py.

    ##Note: this function's module (exprs.basic itself) is fast and harmless enough to reload that it can be
    ##reloaded on every use, without bothering to use reload_once. Therefore, external callers of anything
    ##in the exprs package can always "import basic;reload(basic)" first, and if they do, all modules within
    ##exprs can just start with "from basic import *". But for clarity, some of them call reload_once on basic too.
