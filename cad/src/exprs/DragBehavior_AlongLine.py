the DragBehavior in this file improves on the one in test_statearray_2.py:
- uses its own coordsys, not the one in the Highlightable
- computes the translation from the height (for internal and external use)
- has a range limit

TODO:

needs a refactoring; see comments herein about "refactoring"

[following comment came from DragBehavior.py, guessing it was about this class:]
maybe revise how it works for off-line points -- not closest in space
but closest within a plane perp to screen and -- what? ###

    #  by assuming some other level of self stores some other level of that state. So maybe we create a standard
    #  DragHandling object, then create a behavior-specific delegate to it, to which *it* delegates on_press etc;
