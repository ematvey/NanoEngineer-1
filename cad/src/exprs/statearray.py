# try 1 - works fine, but returns an array of StateRefs to its internal state elements, not lvalue-like state elements.
# This might be useful, and it works and is tested, so rather than altering it and its test code,
# I'll rename it to StateArrayRefs, and keep it around.
# Later I'll write the real StateArray and see if that's indeed easier to use, and/or more efficient, or whatever.

def StateArrayRefs(type_expr, dfltval_expr, **kws): #e refile?
    """An array (expandable, arbitrarily indexed -- really a dictionary) of individually tracked/resettable state variables --
    accessed as individual StateRefs to the variables.
    Usage: in a class definition that uses ExprsMeta,
      attr = StateArrayRefs( type_expr, dfltval_expr )
    creates an attribute in each Instance which is effectively a dictionary of individually change/usage-tracked values,
    each coerced to type_expr [nim] (which can't yet depend on the dictionary index ###FIX),
    and each set to the value of dfltval_expr if it is accessed before it's first set.
       Note: dfltval_expr is evaluated without usage tracking; it is not yet decided whether it's evaluated only once
    (and if so when) or each time it's needed (the latter is more useful, but less efficient in many cases).
    There is not yet any way for dfltval_expr to depend on the dictionary index. ###FIX
       ###e There is not yet a way to control the possible or actual dictionary indices, or to provide an initial default value
    for the array as a whole (it's always {}). See also _CK_ and _CV_ rules, which provide read-only versions of those abilities.
    A combo of a _CK_/_CV_ interface to a StateArray could, for now, do much of what a _CK_-like feature in StateArray should do,
    though much more clumsily. In my first use of this I said "i want an arg for the index set... maybe even the initial set,
    or total set, so i can iter over it..."
    [NOTE: at least one dictlike class has that feature - review the ones in py_utils, see what _CK_ uses]
       ###e there may not yet be a way to delete an element (effectively resetting it to the value of dfltval_expr, computed somewhen).
       ###e there is not yet an unambiguous record of which elements are present or not in the array.
       ###e There is not yet a way to subscribe to updates of the set of defined array element indices,
    nor to updates of all changes to the entire set of values,
    let alone the same features for specific subsets, defined by index preds or sets.
       ###e There is not yet an efficient way to invalidate a range of indices at once
    (letting smart-enoguh subscribers receive just one summary inval).
       ###e There is not yet a way for some of the array to be set to a virtual array (e.g. a view of part of another array or set).
    See also: MapListToExpr, ArgList [nim], InstanceDict [nim], StateArg [nim].
