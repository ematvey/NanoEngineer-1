test code for one kind of constrained dragging

used in testexpr_35b thru 35d in exprs/test.py

the DragBehavior in this file [now in its own file, DragBehavior_AlongLine]
improves on the one in test_statearray_2.py:
- uses its own coordsys, not the one in the Highlightable
- computes the translation from the height (for internal and external use)
- has a range limit

But it needs a refactoring; see comments herein about "refactoring".

# 070318: now that DraggablyBoxed resizer works, I'll revise example 2 in some related ways,

# as example 2, but cleaner code, and could entirely replace it once it works --
# but now they both work (except for different lbox effects) so for now I'll keep them both around.
