# == example 2 -- full of kluges, but may finally work now; abandoned 070318 in favor of example 3

# maybe-partly-obs cmt:
###UNFINISHED in 3 ways (besides the same kluges as in example 1):
# - stores vectors not heights
# - constrain_delta nim, so they'll be dragged in all directions
# + [works now] delta_stateref nim,
#   so dragging these won't actually affect the elements of the StateArray yet, which pretty much bypasses the point.
#   ... done, works, and printit verifies that the statearray values actually change.
# even so, it runs (testexpr_35a).

# UNFINISHED aspects of xxx_drag_behavior:
# - its name
# + implem posn_from_params [done now]
# - the logic bug about self.motion -- ignoring for initial kluge test
# + closest_pt_params_to_ray [coded now]
# - how it fits into anything else -- not using DraggableObject is going to be best in the end,
#   but as initial kluge, just pass it in (wrapping DO as a delegator), and it might work.
# Now [cvs rev 1.15 & 1.16, sometime before 070318] it is supposedly coded enough to work using initial kluge test, but it doesn't work,
# but is making 2 highlightables and showing one and trying to drag the other (and failing). No idea why. [fixed now, see below]
# evidence is "saved modelview_matrix is None, not using it" and the reprs in that debug print and in the cmenu. Hmm. #BUG
# [note, an earlier version (not preserved except in earlier cvs revs of these same classes)
#  did partly work, which stored vectors and had no working constraint on the dragging.]
# Now I fixed that bug by passing _delegate not delegate to drag_handler; see code comment.
