#e PLAN: do more of the kind of thing now done in demo_draw_on_surface.py,
# and integrate it all together using demo_ui.py or so.
#
# Solve some problems of relations between model objects, and savable model objects,
# and autoadding State decls (in wrappers or customizations -- use _e_extend??) to exprs for given attrs.
#
# Keep in mind the need for selection state, bindings in MT that fit with those in graphics area when sensible,
# automaking of PM groups, browsing of available commands (by name or by what they can do)...

# biggest uncomfortablenesses so far:
# - expr prickliness about getattr_Expr from ._e_xxx -- and for that matter the _e_ in the name --
#   if we first-classed them into UnderstoodExpr instances or so, we could use regular attrnames on them
# - some of those things should be functions anyway, I mean methods with args

    #e hmm, can it really be that simple at the end??
    # what about things like their topic, organization into UI, other metainfo...
    # maybe all that can be added by interactive customization??
    # if so, it really can be that simple!
    # in fact, even simpler -- this would be a rule to apply to every "shape class" that gets registered.
    # there'd be lots of rules for lots of different kinds of classes... and lots of customization-interference-points...
    # of course you also want other registered classes to provide customization (like the ones in the same module as the main class)...

# let's think about how, in practice, we extract the arg decls from an expr...

###   TODO   ###   (besides the entire file)
