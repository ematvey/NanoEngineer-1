    # Coding strategy: create an expr with just enough in it to let ExprsMeta's formula scanner do replacements
    # that only it can do (for argpos and attr); then let a helper method do most of the work (when self is known,
    # thus when arglist and its len are known, and type_expr can be evaluated); have it return the list of Instances.
    #
    # (#e In future, the helper might return a list-like object which makes Instances lazily, though I'd guess this
    #  rarely matters in practice -- but who knows, what if we use this for the textlines in a text editor?)

      map_Expr( func, remaining args - from which it uses argpos


                helper func

                runs on the arg exprs and argpos
                calls .Instance a lot
                uses same argpos index as if not in a list? no, uses its own plus the one in the list

      helper can wrap _i_instance


      does it call grabarg in usual way? I guess so

      



can we generate a bunch of Arg calls w/ special options for index, and return a list of evalexprs of them?
ie a list of instances as our value
