scratch so far, coming out of discussion of a better syntax for testexpr_19f,
but it's likely to be made real.

    # btw, does that mean Arg & Instance need to be upgraded to be usable directly as Exprs?
    # or do the things they produce work when passed in a list, if we scan them in the same way as ExprsMeta does?

    #  even if only by extracting arg-defaults from the lambda and then calling it with a full arglist made using those,
