# PixelTester is untested -- not even fully parsed by python yet

##e needs save button, per-session filenames, access to on disk log of prior files,
# or way of reading new image from same file, and including reread-policy
# (and id if done "by command to instance")
# along with filename in the texture-dict key
# (but optim for when multiple reads got same image data, whether by same instance or different ones??
#  not simple -- eg if single textures have varying data or (worse for displists) names, other issues, and somewhat orthogonal)
