IntrinsicVertex = ...
    we want to say that pos is a formula of lpos and some coords
    ( a reversible formula -- lpos can be set by setting pos -- due to coords or the coord-combining-op supporting that)
    and the obj that supplies the coords is an arg
    and a policy option says whether we grab a snapshot of those coords from that obj, or continuously regrab them, as obj moves
    (but even in first case a cmenu item would let us regrab them -- so it still knows the obj)
    (but it does have its own copy of the coords, I guess -- and the precise type of those depends on the nature of the obj)
    
    note: coords is correct but don't be fooled -- it's a semiarb map from some coords to others -- not an affine map!
    so for a point on a sphere, the intrinsic coords are a surface point on unit sphere and a radius ratio...
    or a radius offset if you prefer -- different types.

    what does the eg look like, for a radius ratio, with a policy option for autoupdate or just update?

    coords = formula(guideshape), update = True or False

    pos = coords(lpos) # reversible -- how do we say so?

    pos = Reversible(coords(lpos)) #??
    pos = Alias(coords(lpos)) #??
    pos = Lvalue(coords(lpos)) #??
    pos = Settable(coords(lpos)) #??

    # or just let it be implied by the expr coords(lpos) due to the lexically declared type of coords? (sounds too hard for now)
    # or have a separate list of things you can set, to change other things, which says you can set pos to change lpos?
    # (a list of different ways to change it, each having a list in priority order of things to keep fixed or set as requested;
    #  in this case the list would say, supply pos, fix coords, derive lpos, I guess...
    # or that you can derive lpos from pos?
    
    # goal: know what can be specified, to get what -- and how to do this (at least, what to ask to do it, ie coords)

    # does it relate to what data's type needs to know the code to do it? ie it's not just lpos + coords = pos, solved for lpos --
    # the knowledge of how is *in coords*, not in some outer + operation. So it's really that coords gets pos from lpos, reversibly.
    # It's like an optional attr of the formula, or even of the expr coords(lpos).

        # or capitalize guide.Coords since it's a type, in a sense? not sure. it's also or more a func...
        # why is this not just a formula? because update might be false. But if it's true? because guide shape might *lose* its coords,
        # e.g. if it disappears entirely (gets deleted from model);
        # then the update fails, but this does not lose the coords! it's just a warning (about the data object -- maybe not even
        # seen except on demand, ie really info not warning), and they are still locally there & useable. So it's State for sure.
        # OTOH it's not settable except by taking a snapshot of the declared formula, I guess... not sure if that's essential.
        # I wonder if we should even declare it like this:

    # btw are we going to let people in general use Args (with known names, as they always have) as Options? at least for customization? #e
    # when that happens, are they removed from the remaining arglist?
