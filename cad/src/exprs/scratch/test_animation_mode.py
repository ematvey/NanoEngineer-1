test_animation_mode.py -- scratch code for animation loop, connectWithState, exprs drawing.

@author: Bruce
@version: $Id: test_animation_mode.py 14375 2008-09-30 04:14:50Z brucesmith $

To run this code:

1. shell commands to make a symbolic link
(or you can copy it if you don't want to recommit your edits):

% cd ~/Nanorex/Modes
% ln -s /Nanorex/trunk/cad/src/exprs/scratch/test_animation_mode.py .  # or whatever this file's absolute pathname is

2. rerun NE1 (needed?)

3. debug menu -> custom modes -> test_animation_mode

History: this was mostly written long ago in my spare time,
just for fun. I put it in cvs since it's sometimes useful now
as a testbed.

Bugs:

updated 070831

- Needs fix for exit to remove PM tab, like in test_commands

- Performance is worse in NE1 PyOpenGL than in the PyOpenGL I have on the iMac G5
  (the same thing is true for testmode)

- refers to a missing image file on my desktop

(out of date below this)

test_animation_mode bugs as of 060219 night:
- loop stops; should be checkbox
- arrow keys are not camera relative; they're player-rel but player never turns; really they're world-rel (which is wrong)
- camera never tries to swing behind player
- camera dynamics are not very good (should get there faster, stop sooner, maybe have inertia)
- stuff is not in MT or mmp file
- stuff is not very interesting yet

and a couple more noted on g4:
- antialiasing
- a few more

    Hold some text which can be edited and displayed, and a few properties to control when/where/how to display it.
    Also try to let it exist in cyberspace, i.e. when it's changed, store it there, and when we're reshown, reload it from there.
    For initial test, cyberspace means a file whose basename we contain and whose dirname is hardcoded.
    Or a prefs db entry, or something like that.
    - Hmm... how does user make one? Mt cmenu.
    - How does user edit text? Ideally, select node, then text is shown in editable text field.
    This field is only there when something has text to edit (not nec. us).
    Optional cool feature: if multiple nodes selected, show all of them (editably) in that text field (longer, scrollable).
    - Where do we put that text field? Better make one... no good place at the moment.
    Do we have *any* code to grab for that?
    - history widget
    - debug text edit
    - glpane text, with our own key bindings for editing -- sounds harder, not sure it really is (need focus to follow selected node)
    Related nE-1 desired features:
    - edit props for any node, in a pane added below it in MT when it's selected -- this is almost identical to what we want here
    - text-containing node, for notes, or display in 3dview -- also almost identical
    - the cyberspace part is the only weird part
    So, what to do?
    - have a text widget at MT bottom, hide/show on demand
    - be able to tie it to edit any textual lvalue; some owner takes it over by providing that lval's API, later releases it,
      and new owners can also kick out old ones
    - this node, when selected, takes it over unless it's locked, or always if some cmenu command is used or if it's unlocked
    - this locking is controlled by a cmenu on the text widget, or a checkbox, or equivalent

    _e_is_instance = True # I predict this just gets to another exception... if it's even correct --
        # it might be wrong to say it in the class itself!!! anyway it didn't complain about that
        # but i was right, it then asked for _i_env_ipath_for_formula_at_index...
        # so there is a set of things we need, to be able to support formulae like that one for transient_state,

        # like child instances, call == customize, etc.

        # So there are different ways to go: ### DECIDE:
        # - revise State to work without transient_state [probably desirable in the long run, anyway]
        # - make a more standalone way of defining transient_state
        # - split IorE into the part we want here and the rest (the part we want here might be a post-mixin)
        # - revise IorE to be safe to inherit here (as a post-mixin I guess), ie make it ask us what __call__ should do.
        #
        # Let's see what happens if we just inherit IorE. maybe it already works due to _e_is_instance,
