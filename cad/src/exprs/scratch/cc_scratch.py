###e change that into: InstanceMemoizer subclass with methods to turn args to index, index to expr??
# in fact, best if we could dynamically separate it into an InstanceHolder(glpane)
# and a way for one thing inside that (findable at some index and using state at that index or inside self)
# to be a cc_memoizer. In fact, since cc_memoizer is an IorE, that might be required... ###k FIGURE OUT

# TODO:
#  ###IMPLEM skip_expr_compare - done, untested, maybe not needed here anymore
#  see what env.make does... just eval and _e_make_in; call it like env.make(expr, ipath).
# set up one of the above cc_memoizer objects
# set up its drawing env (with glpane & stateplace), initial ipath, etc -- hmm, is some of that needed in the data? no, to find the obj.

# set up cc_memoizer - needs glpane, so needs to be an attr of some object -- which one? glpane itself??? yes!
# or should glpane have a mixin which gives it this power to own an env and make objects in it?
