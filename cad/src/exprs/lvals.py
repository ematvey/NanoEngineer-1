lvals.py - various kinds of "lvalue" objects (slots for holding attribute values)

===

Ways in which lval classes need to differ from each other:

- how the value they represent is "delivered" (on request of a caller, calling a get_value method or the like):

  - (e.g. as a return value, or as an externally stored value, or as side effects)

  - (e.g. with or without a version-counter)

- how the fact of their value's usage is recorded in the dynamic environment, and what kind of usage is recorded

  - kinds of usage:
    calls of display lists,
    uses of other external objects (qt widgets, opengl state),
    uses of ordinary usage-tracked variables

  (but if dynamic env wants to record usage in order of occurrence, I think it can do that without affecting the track_use API)

- how the decision of what needs recomputing is made

  - e.g. what kinds of inval flags, whether to diff input values before deciding, whether to do partial or incremental recomputes

- with what API the recomputing is accomplished (e.g. call a supplied function, perhaps with certain args)

- how invals of the current value can/should be propogated to previous users of the current value

Other differences, that should *not* be reflected directly in lval classes
(but that might have specific helper functions in this module):

- the specific formula being recomputed (whether expressed a python compute method, an interpreted HL math expr, or a draw method)

- whether some of the storage implied above (eg value caches, usage lists and their subs records, inval flags and their user lists)
  is stored separately from formula instances (to permit sharing of formulas) --
  because if it is, then just make an lval class that calls a different kind of formula (passing it more args when it runs),
  but let the lval class itself be per-storage-instance

- whether the lvalues reside in a single object-attr, or a dict of them -- just make an attr or dict of lvals,
  and have the owning class access them differently.

For examples, see the classes herein whose names contain Lval.

    # Implem notes:
    #
    # - This object can't be a Python descriptor (in a useful way), because its storage has to be per-instance.
    #   [I suppose we could separate it from its storage, and then that might not be true.
    #    But it's simpler this way, especially since we sometimes store one in a visibly-indexed dict rather than an object-attr.]
    # - If a descriptor (which has to be per-class) uses one of these, it has to look up the one to use in each instance.
    #   So the only reason not to provide this Lval with a bound recompute method would be to avoid cyclic references.
    #   At the moment, that's not crucial.
    # - When we want that, this still has the storage, but it can be given an owner obj each time it runs.
    #   It could just as well be given the compute method each time; for either one, the owner has to give the same one each time
    #   or the inval flag etc won't be correct.
    # - The compute method it's given (once or each time) could be a bound instance method (from a _C_attr method),
    #   or something created from a formula on _self, also bound to a value for _self. Whatever it is, we don't care how it's made,
    #   so we might as well accept any callable. It might be made in various ways, by descriptors or helper functions like LvalDict.
    #
    # - The mixins provide these methods, for internal use:
    #   - SelfUsageTrackingMixin: track_use, track_change == track_inval --
    #       for tracking how our value is used, is changed, is indirectly invalled.
    #   - SubUsageTrackingMixin: begin_tracking_usage, end_tracking_usage -- for tracking which values we use when we recompute.
    #   - They're the same mixins used for displists used by chunk/GLPane and defined in chunk, and for changes to env.prefs, 
    #     so these Lvals will work with those (except for chunk not yet propogating invals or tracking changes to its display list).
    #   - See comments near those methods in changes.py for ways they'll someday need extension/optimization for this use.
