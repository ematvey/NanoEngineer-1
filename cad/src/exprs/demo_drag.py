demo not only some drag actions, but some ways of setting up new model types
and their edit tools and behaviors. [Eventually.]

[for current status see comments just before GraphDrawDemo_FixedToolOnArg1]

070105 moved the pseudocode for Command & DragCommand class etc into new file Command_scratch_1.py --
see it for ideas about Command, DragCommand, _PERMIT_SETS_INSIDE_, DragANode, ClickDragCommand, MakeANode.
(But some comments below still discuss Command and MakeANode in important ways.)

Notable bug (really in check_target_depth in GLPane, not this file): highlighted-object-finder
can be fooled by nearby depths due to check_target_depth_fudge_factor of 0.0001. This caused
a bug here, which is so far only worked around (by increasing DZFUZZ), not really fixed. [070115 comment]

    """
    # 070223 possible fix to seeing depth of self: during a drag, tell glpane not to draw dragobj into depth or during glselect

    # so you can see selobj behind it, or diff color when there is a selobj...
    
    ###e about what to rename it... Hmm, is it a general "Draggable"? .lookslike arg2 -> .islike or .thing arg1?
    
    # BTW, the highlightability is not yet specified here ###nim; it relates to the fact that we can bind commands to it
    # (as opposed to things it contains or is contained in, tho that should be permitted at the same time,
    #  tho implem requires nested glnames to sometimes ignore inner ones, when those are inactive);
    # but we might add it in a wrapper which makes it into a view of it that lets commands be bound to it,
    # except that World.draw assumes we draw the actual model objs, not wraps of them - also an issue if env says they
    # look different -- so maybe World needs to wrap all it draws with glue to add looks and behavior to it, in fact.
    # [update much later 070201: or maybe ModelObject knows about this and asks env whether to override default drawing code.]

    #e we probably want to combine pos0/pos into one StateArg so it's obvious how they relate,
    # and only one gets saved in file, and only one self.attr name is used up and accessible

    # the rest of this class is for drawing it and interacting with it.
    # Can we move that code into e.g. VertexDrawable or VertexView
    # and have Vertex itself just delegate (for sake of draw, lbox, etc) to some rule in the env for getting a Drawable for it,
    # probably looking it up in a dynamic memoizing mapping in the env? ####e [070105]
    # I think YES.
    # - a main difference between a model & view object -- a view obj knows how to draw itself, a model obj asks the env.
    #   (and the answer is quite different in different envs, e.g. 3d area vs MT. but what if we mix those?)
    # related notes:
    # - it might want a different delegate for drawing purposes (draw, lbox) and sim purposes (or others).
    # - does it also have an attr corresponding to its index/address/id in the model world?
    # - and maybe some for relations to other model objs, eg MT-parent, tags, name, etc?
    # - and maybe some graphics prefs like color or whatever, even if it's up to the drawing rule whether/how to use these?
    # - and for that matter some arbitrary other data (named attrs), as we'll let any model object have?
    # simplest thing that could work --
    # - make some sort of MemoDict for model-view and put it into the env, even if we kluge how to set it up for now.
    #   how does demo_MT do it? With a hardcoded helper function using a MemoDict in a simple way -- no involvement of env.
    #   So see above for copied code from that... ###e

    #e so now what we want is for this (in super modelobject) to delegate to a computed viewer from the helper func above

## class World(ModelObject) -- moved to world.py, 070201

# ok, now how do we bind a click on empty space to class MakeANode ?

# note, someday we might just as easily bind a click on some guide surface
# (onto which we've applied an active tool to interpret clicks)
# to that command, as binding a click on empty space to it. The point is, we have tools, with cmds in them,
# and we bind tools to objects or to pieces of space (see scratch6 and recent notesfiles).
#
# so we can separate this: #####IMPLEM all these
# - put this command and others (for other modkeys) into a tool, and
# - make a button for a pallette which can (when run on a selected space or surface, or on the current space)
#   - bind that tool to empty space or to a guide surface.
# - make a pallette with that button
# - show this pallette.
# - make a space object... is it that World object above, or only sometimes, or only temporarily?
#   well, the tool can change for the same world, the world concerns itself only with what kind of data it can hold
#   (and it may offer a set of tools, or have a default one, or have implems of std-named ones...)

# but for an initial test, we can always be in this kind of world, have one tool implicitly, on entire space --
# but this does require changing the click-action. OR we could create a big image as a guide shape, and put click action on that.
# Hmm, I think that's easier, I'll try that first.

# Let's do it with a DNA origami image... but first, just a rect. So, we want a modifier for a thing (the rect)
# which gives it the event bindings implied by this tool. I.e. a macro based on Highlightable.


# status 061205 1022p: works (in this initial klugy form, not using Command classes above) except for recording points in abs coords
# (wrong) but drawing them in arb rel coords (wrong), when both need to be in a specified coord sys, namely that of the bg rect object.

# status 061207 ~9am: coords were fixed last night, and drag now works as of thismorning. simple demo draws blue nodes along the drag.
# In theory it's using depth found at each point, so it could draw on a 3d curved surface -- but that's not tested. [later, it is.]

# 061213 bug report, trivial: draws just in front, but in model coords, not screen coords. For trackball and then draw on back or
# other side, screen coords would work better -- or maybe object-surface-coords (as some comment suggests) would be better still,
# but for non-enclosed objs like planes, note that that depends on screen coords to know which face is facing the user.

        #
        # ... except for desirable improvements:
        # - we should replace DZ with "local perp to surface" to make the drawn things more visible.
        # - And we *might* want to replace depth with "computed true depth", since for a sphere, as we rotate the view
        #   the drawn radius slightly changes due to where the triangle faces are located, and this can bury the drawing of marks
        #   if they are really close to the sphere --
        # - either that, or record their posns relative to the sphere surface,
        #   which might be most correct anyway -- and especially useful if we change the radius of the sphere! (making it balloon-like)
        # - Also those things are oriented in global coords rather than coords based on the clicked surface.
        #   Fixing that would also make them "look oriented" and help you perceive their depth when they're over a curved surface.

            # [later 061213:] IIRC the status was: I made GLPane_overrider so I could fix that 2-glname issue in it,
            # but never got to that yet. Meanwhile I commented out the use of this expr, and thus on_drag_node is never used...
            # and Vertexes dragged directly do nothing -- they're highlightable but with no actions.
            # And World could probably draw them highlightable even if they weren't, but it doesn't.
            # BTW the disabled nonworking draggable_node_expr is not well-designed -- it does not add a Vertex to World, it adds a
            # draggable one -- but even World is not perfect, since it contains Vertexes (not just their data)
            # and they inherently have (a lack of) action bindings since they are Highlightable.
            # Probably better would be if World contained data-nodes and had access to (or had its own) display rules for them
            # which added commands/actions based on the currently active tools. That would help with tool-code-reloading too.
            # Probably some other comments here say this too.
            #
            # So does a World need a formula or function arg for how to map its data objects to display objects, at the moment?
            # Or is there some scheme of a global map for that, to be applied when "drawing" any data object?
            # And do some data objs have their own positions, or is that always supplied by the world or other data obj they're in?
            # In theory, we might display atoms at posns unrelated to atom.pos, e.g. as a row in a table which includes their coords.
            # So it's more like we have ways of "drawing a set of things" which can say "at posns given by func(thing)"
            # or "at successive posns in a column", corresponding to two display forms with different exprs,
            # with the map from thing to individual display form also needing to be specified.
            # So a World is more like a set of things, and it can have a display mode (or more than one), given a thing-display-function.
            # We can ask it or anything else how it recommends displaying itself given display style options,
            # but we can choose to use that display function (from it to a more directly displayable object) or use another one.
            # Or we can probably just "draw it" and have it pick up the current display style from the env (including the
            # currently active tools). Is there any reason not to permit both? (draw using current style, draw using given style,
            # give me function from you to drawables using given style, use specific function and draw the results -- all possible.)
            # 
            # If a thing in a world has standard mouse actions of its own, can it also have "grabbable areas" for use in dragging it
            # when it has a posn as displayed in some world? Or did that world have to explicitly turn it into a draggable thing?
            # Answer: both. The world turns it into that by adding a drag binding for those "overall handles" the thing has.
            # It might draw them with glnames in some set it knows... ie as named subobjs of itself. The overall thing might also
            # have a single name. Then we have a sequence of two glnames meaning obj/subobj which we want to use to determine the action.
            # For some subobjs that's within the object and supplied by it (perhaps depending on tool); for others,
            # it's supplied by the World it's in (also dep on a tool) and handled by it (eg move the obj, select the obj).
            #
            # For the simple things we have there, there are no subobjects, and no actions except drag or later select the whole thing.
            # A simple model is "one thing was hit, but some things are specified by a specific series of two or more glnames".
            # In general the outer name decides how to interpret (or whether to ignore) the inner names.
            # It can map the inner ones somehow... not sure how. This will relate a lot to DisplayListChunk when we have that.
