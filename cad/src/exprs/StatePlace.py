    """In a class definition for an InstanceOrExpr subclass, use the assignment

        <kind>_state = StatePlace(<kind>, <ipath_expr>)

    (for a short string <kind>, usually one of a small set of conventional kinds of storage)
    to cause self.<kind>_state in each Instance to refer to external state specific to
    <ipath_expr> as evaluated in that Instance (by default, _self.ipath, meaning specific
    to that Instance, though usually more persistent than it, perhaps depending on <kind>).

    By default, that state is fully usage-tracked and change-tracked; it should only be
    changed when processing a mouse click or keystroke or similar user action, and changing it
    will invalidate any model variables or drawing side effects that used the prior value of
    the same state. (Changing it *during* model computations or drawing code can cause undetected
    errors and/or detected bad bugs.)

    If tracked = False, then that state is not usage-tracked or change-tracked at all. This is
    appropriate for certain "kinds" of state, e.g. temporary per-frame variables used for drawing code.
    (Some such state could probably just be stored in each Instance, but this is not yet clear. #k)

    It's usually necessary to initialize the contents of the declared stateplaces
    using set_default_attrs in _init_instance, or the like. (Note that the stateplace is often
    found rather than created, and the same sometimes goes for individual attrs within it.
    Both this StatePlace  declaration and set_default_attrs take this into account by only initializing
    what's not already there.)

    See also the [nim] State declaration for use with individual attrs.

    # - if obj is wrong type, we might even coerce it, eg add glue code to improve the api, make it relative to our own coords, etc,

    #   we'd better make it clear what type to create it as externally (for others to also see)
    #   vs what type to coerce/glue that too locally (for private use). So we really have to say both the external & local types,
    #   or the external type & local mapping from that, or something like that.
    #   In fact -- maybe even give the two versions different names; which probably implies,
    #   set up a dependency between different external data.
    # - be able to initialize subattrs, like self.state.x.y -- do by creating x of desired type, then doing x.y inside x --
    #   but Q, do you do this if x.y is not there in x, but x is already there, or only if even x is not already there?
    #   usually the first, meaning, use two separate calls of this, but can one notation do it all? (and do we need that?)
    # - we might want a toplevel (expr syntax) version of all this, for use in pure-expr-notation programs; related to LocalState
    #   (see notesfile), esp if that really sets up a local *ref* to perhaps-external state.
    # In the future, it might work differently -- maybe we won't want attrs with default values to use up space,
    # when possible (not possible for the ones stored in allocated slots in arrays), so this will be replaced with
    # some sort of per-class per-kind attr decl, which includes the type & default value. (For that, see the [nim] State decl.)
