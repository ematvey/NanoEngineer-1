# There are 15 non-noop combos of dx & dy formulae, but only 13 have simple names, due to X/Y ambiguity of Center...
# even so, I spell them out like this, partly since the resulting classes are more efficient
# than the easy implems of a general version which takes args for what to do with x & y independently.
# Maybe the missing ones could be called CenterX and CenterY? (They do nothing to the not-named coordinate.) Done.
# See testexpr_21e for a table of all of them.

# BTW they need docstrings; here is an old one for Center:
"Center(thing) draws as thing (a Widget2D [#e should make work for 3D too]), but is centered on the origin"

        # guess: ExprsMeta stores it, then stores these new ones, but doesn't know it needs to "revisit" that one (for delegate)
        # and remake it for subclass with revised dx/dy. (Ideally it would remake it afresh for each subclass, I guess... how hard??)
        # conclusion: debug that, but for now, don't use the AlignmentExpr superclass, just spell out each subclass.
        # update, 080514: obvious in hindsight: when the delegate formula in AlignmentExpr is executed by Python,
        # dx is 0 so it might as well be defining delegate = Translate(thing, V_expr(0,0,0)).
        # So there is no fix without revising that definition or the defs of dx, dy.

# pre-061211 version of Center, also worked fine:
##class Center(InstanceMacro):
##    "Center(thing) draws as thing (a Widget2D [#e should make work for 3D too]), but is centered on the origin"
##    # args
##    thing = Arg(Widget2D)
##    # internal formulas - decide how much to translate thing
##    dx = (thing.bleft - thing.bright)/2.0
##    dy = (thing.bbottom - thing.btop)/2.0
##    # value
##    ###k for now, use V_expr instead of V when it has expr args... not sure we can get around this (maybe redef of V will be ok??)
##    _value = Translate(thing, V_expr(dx,dy,0)) # this translates both thing and its layout box ###k might not work with V(expr...)
##    pass

# end
