demo_polyline.py -- demo file for Polyline datatype (too unsophisticated for real life) and related commands

$Id: demo_polyline.py 11951 2008-03-14 04:44:50Z ericmessick $

The "demo" in the filename indicates that this is not part of the exprs module per se,
but shows how to use it for a specific app. For use in our real app, lots of this will
be moved into new files and made more sophisticated (relative coords, relations, better editing, etc).

See also:
- demo_polygon.py,
- class polyline in testexpr_19g demo_drag.py
- (superseded by demo_draw_on_surface.py once that works),
- DragCommand scratch,
- free x-y rot code in draggable.py,
- demo_ui.py (which is supposed to be able to provide access to these commands).

'''say above: intercept in testmode - baremotion, update_selobj i guess
and some other selobj controls
prob no need to intercept them in selectMode itself
but i am not sure...
i could have said the same about all my other mods to it...
'''

#e also move new incr methods in controls.py to class HL 

#e also say above where we get in and out of opengl xor mode, and grab eg code from cookiemode or zoom or whatever to do that
# (as helper methods in the superclass, or a mixin just for xormode drawing, which could define a swapbuffers method too)

# btw is xormode used now for incr drawing in selmode itself, for region sel -- and if not why not?
# is region sel itself able to be a cmd of this form -- even though the std editmode might get into it as its emptySpaceLeftDown?
# btw, an advantage of xor mode in that case - it's ok if you didn't have a premade screen image around.

'''really do review class polyline soon, and old demo_polygon too, esp for its Command supers, and command_scratch file too.

an eg issue that came up in class polyline:
we need to know what the sketch entity coords are rel to. If it's both draggable, and in/on a ref plane or surface,
then it might be two-level-relative... tho the relativity for Draggable is probably best thought of as transient.

ui discussion: the initial editmode lets you click to add segments, or Undo to un-add them i think (ie to undo the last click
 but not get out of being in the rubberband line mode),
but there is also some way to drag verts or edges or add new control points or remove old ones...
but how is that controlled -- a toolset in the PM? yet another level of flyout toolbar? PM tools seem preferable...

code structure discussion: class polyline is one thing, and an editable view of it another,
and they are different! The editable view is made by mapping the polyline elements into drawables with bindings,
which differ depending on editmode and tool... tho for just making it (not fancier editing) this might not be needed.
