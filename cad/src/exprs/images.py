semi-obs documentation:

Image(filename) # a tile, exact same size as image in file (which loads into a texture, rounded up to twopow sizes)

can be used as a texture, or drawn using pixel ops

Image(filename, width, height) # if only width is given, preserves aspect ratio (or only height, possible when names used)
  (that's tricky to declare using defaults, btw; maybe default = None or Automatic)

it can be rotated, translated, etc

Q. what if we want to do image ops to get another image
and use general tex coords to draw that?

A. we need the image obj lying around, without drawing it.

Q. do we keep one cache of image objs from filenames?
A. yes.

Note name conflict: our class Image, and PIL's Image class.

To avoid even more confusion, I'll name this module images.py rather than Image.py
(but note, there exists an unrelated directory cad/images).

    Image(filename, size = Rect(2)) draws a rectangular textured image based on the given image file,
    using the same size and position in model space as the lbox of an instance of self.size
    (a Widget2D, usually a Rect, Rect(2) by default, i.e. about 30 pixels square in home view).
       It uses an OpenGL texture size (resolution) given by options ideal_width and ideal_height
    [#e which need renaming, making into one option, and other improvements; see code comments for details].
       [It doesn't yet work in POV-Ray but it ought to someday. #e]
       The other options are not fully documented here, and need improvements in design and sometimes in implem,
    but are summarized here:
       Options that affect how the file gets loaded into a PIL Image include rescale, convert, _tmpmode [#doc these],
    as well as the texture size options mentioned.
    (The PIL Image object is available as self._image even if our OpenGL texture is not used. [#doc more details?]
    [###WRONG or REVIEW -- isn't it the nEImageOps object which has that name??])
       Options that affect how the texture gets made from the loaded image include... none yet, I think. Someday
    we'll want make_mipmaps (with filtering options for its use) and probably others. [###k need to verify none are used for this]

    @warning: variations in the above options (between instances, or over time [if that's implemented -- untested,

              implem [i think] -- but the lack of image->texture options makes this academic for now) a new PIL Image to be created
              from the image file on disk.

       Options that affect how the texture is drawn (in any instance, at any moment) include:
    clamp, pixmap [#e misnamed], use_mipmaps, decal, tex_origin, nreps [#doc these].
    [#e More options of this kind are needed.]
    All the texture-drawing options can be varied, either in different instances or over time in one instance
    (by passing them as formulae), without causing a new texture or PIL Image to be loaded as they vary. 

    @warning: the image is not visible from the back by default,
              which is only ok for some uses, such as 2D widgets
              or solid-object faces or decals. Use two_sided = True
