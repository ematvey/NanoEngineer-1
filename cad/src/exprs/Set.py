Set.py - provide the assignment action called Set, and (for now) the deprecated older variant SetStateRefValue.

Note: this operation name is important enough to override any worry about the potential
name conflict with something related to mathematical set-theory sets or Python dict-like sets.

And the use on arg1 being an lvalue is important enough to not worry much if arg1 being a stateref is
harder to use -- now done in SetStateRefValue, might later be done in Set(stateref.value, ...).

History, status, plans:

first implem of SetStateRefValue written in controls.py, moved here 061203, renamed from Set to SetStateRefValue 061204.

adding Set with arg1 an lval eg a getattr_Expr, 061204; works in testexpr_16
