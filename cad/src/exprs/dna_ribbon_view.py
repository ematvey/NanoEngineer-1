070125: started this from a copy of demo_dna-outtakes.py.

[Since then, that file has been cvs-removed -- see 070201 comment below.]

Eventually this will have some display styles for DNA double helix segments,
with the model aspects of those defined in separate files,
but to get started, we might make self-contained exprs which handle two parts of this
that ought to be separated:

- think of some external "control point" state as "state describing a DNA double helix segment";

- draw a "DNA double helix segment" in various ways.

We'll break it down into separate expr classes for the operations:

- make dna seg params from control points,

- generate various useful geometric objects from those and from simpler or higherlevel ones,

- draw those individually,

- put that together to draw a DNA segment.

Then it can all be put together into a demo in which the control points are draggable.

In the future we can let a "dna model object" know how to get its params
from a variety of input types in different ways, and know how to display itself
or make it work to find the display rules externally and apply them to it.
To some extend we can prefigure that now if we break things down in the right way.


070130: the tension between arrays of unlabeled numbers (efficiency, LL code convenience)
and typesafe geometric objects (points, knowing their coords intrinsicness & coordsys & space, etc)
is a problem, but the best-guess resolution is to make "rich objects" available (with all such
type info, metainfo, extra info -- e.g. normal and surface (incl its own local coordsys vectors
within the tangent plane, or enough info to derive them) and object-we-mark for points),
but also make coords available, in standard coordsystems, informal at first, later available
as metainfo for specific attrs; and someday to bridge the gap by working primarily with rich *arrays*
of data, so the number ops can be done by Numeric or the like, expressing the HL ops with exprs.
In the meantime it's a continual hassle, seen in the present Qs about types like Cylinder and
Cylinder_HelicalPath.


070131/070201: for now, coordinates are handled by using all the same ones (same as drawing coords)
in any given object. The object is responsible for knowing what coords it uses in kids it makes
(and the ones here just use the same ones in kids and in themselves).

This means a cylinder with markings, to be efficient re display lists when moved/rotated [which is nim],
should have that move/rotate done outside it (not modifying anything it stores), in a manner not yet
worked out. Maybe the easiest way is for it to make an exception and contain an outer repositioner
wrapping everything else it draws... tho if that repositioner could be entirely outside it, that might be better --
but only if not having one is an option; especially useful if there can be different kinds, e.g. for gridded drags.
The outer repositioner could also be temporary, with coord changes reflected inside the object eventually
(similar to chunks, which often reset their base coords to abs coords or a translated version of them).
This is all TBD. ###e


070201: for now, length units will be handled by using nm everywhere. This is a kluge for the lack of
an adjustable relation between NE1 model-drawing-coords and physical distance; it will make DNA look the
right size on screen. But it's incompatible with drawing atoms (assuming you want them to look in the same
scale as the DNA -- not clear, if they are in a different model that happens to be shown at the same time!)
Later we'll have to coexist better with atoms using angstroms, perhaps by making physical & drawing units
explicit for each object -- or for individual numbers and numeric arrays if we can do that efficiently
(which probably means, if we implement the unit/coord compatibility checks and wrapping/unwrapping in C).


070201: moved still-useful scraps we're not using now to another file,
dna_ribbon_view_scraps.py, including most of what remains from demo_dna-outtakes.py,
which I'm cvs-removing. (The only reason I might want to look it up in cvs would be
for help making the OpenGL do what it used to do, if that's ever needed.)

    But there is no requirement that a specific cylinder be symmetric. (It will be if n_turns_left == n_turns_right in its state.)
    The central segment (not really central if it's not symmetric) is thought of as the seam (for origami)
    and is used as an origin for the indexing of inter-base segments and bases, as follows:
    - base-position indices are 0,1,2 to the right of (after) this origin, and -1, -2, etc to the left.
    - inter-base segments are numbered 0 at this origin (and in general, by the following base).
    This means the order is ... base(-1) -- segment(0)(== origin) -- base(0) -- ...
    (Note: this is subject to revision if it turns out some other scheme is standard or much better. ###e)
       Note that ficticious segment numbers at the ends, which have only one endpoint that's a real base index,
    might be useful in some places, but won't be included by default when iterating over inter-base helix segments.
    That is, by default (when accessing related attrs), there will be one fewer inter-base segment than base.

    #   strand2_theta = Option( Degrees, _self.strand1_theta - offset ) # raises CircularDefinitionError (saying the cycle it found?)

    # PROBLEM: I suspect the behavior depends on the order of eval of the defs, at least if cycles break in more than one place.
    # PROBLEM: you have to manually create the proper inverse formulas -- nothing catches mistake if they're not inverses.
    # PROBLEM: the above might work for initial sets (from being unset) --

        #   and call it for all baremotion, with either side effects or retval saying whether new highlight image,
        #   sbar text, or cmenu point is needed. (Totally doable, but not completely trivial.)
        # - Or, have intra-selobj different 2nd glnames, and when they change, act like it is (or might be) a new selobj.
        #   This is not a lot different from just splitting things into separate selobjs (tho it might be more efficient
        #   in some cases, esp. if you wanted to use weird gl modes for highlighting, like xormode drawing; alternatively
        #   it might be simpler in some cases).
        # - Or, just support posn-specific selobj cmenu (but not sbar or highlight image changes):
        #   that could be simpler: just save the point (etc) somewhere
        #   (as computed in baremotion to choose the selobj), and have it seen by current_event_mousepoint in place of
        #   glpane._leftClick_gl_event_info (or rename that and use the same attr).
