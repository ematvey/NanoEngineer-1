History:

061231 prototyped this code in NewInval.py

070102 moved it here 1-2 days ago, and revised it to seem correct; imports/reloads ok, but otherwise untested

070103 works, with important caveats re Highlightable (described below)

080215 renamed from DisplistChunk to DisplayListChunk

==

Still needed:
- maybe: some renamings, as commented
- provisions for highlighting (see just below in this docstring)
- include texture/image contents in the same scheme -- analogous to displist contents.
  Requires giving them compatible owner objects and treating those like we treat the ones
  for directly called display lists, aka sublists.

==

caveats re Highlightable [as of 070103]:

a Highlightable inside a DisplayListChunk only works properly (without highlight-position errors)
if no coord transform occurs from the DisplayListChunk to the Highlightable,
and no trackballing or other motion of whole thing from the last time the instance was made.
The second condition is impossible to guarantee, so in practice,
you should not use a Highlightable inside a DisplayListChunk until this is fixed.

Theory: the gl matrix is saved only once and only as it was when the displist was compiled.
Note, the rules would be even weirder (I predict) if nested display lists were involved --
then we'd need no transforms in any of them, re their calls of the next, for current code to work.

The best fix is the one planned on paper a few weeks ago -- have ExprsMeta decorate draw methods
with something that can call only the needed ones in a special scan for implementing draw_in_abs_coords.
(Idea now: the tree whose paths from root need to be marked, to implem that, is the tree of original
calls of draw methods. This was supposed to equal the ipath-suffix tree. Hopefully it does. If not,
the decorated draw methods themselves could generate ipath-like things for this purpose -- or really,
just pointers to the draw-method-owning parents in each one, to be stored in the objects with the draw methods.)

###@@@ Q: do we separate the object to own a displist, below, and the one to represent various Instances,
# like one for DisplayListChunk and one for defining a displist-subroutine?
# (Do these even differ? [062023 addendum: One way they differ: whether highlighting treats their instances as separate objects.
#   But it might turn out this is just a matter of whether we use a DisplayListChunk inside something for highlighting
#   which pushes its own glname for everything inside it, crossing it with whatever ones are inside it rather than being
#   overridden by them (just a flag on the name which matters when it's interpreted).])
# If we do, is the class below even an Instance with a draw method? (I doubt it. I bet it's an internal displist-owner helper object.)

#e digr: someday: it might be good for glpane to have a dict from allocated dlist names to their owning objects.
# Could we use displist names as keys, for that purpose?

    def draw(self):
        """Basically, we draw by emitting glCallList, whether our caller is currently
        compiling another display list or executing OpenGL in immediate mode.
           But if our total drawing effects are invalid (i.e. our own list and/or some list it calls
        has invalid contents), we must do some extra things, and do them differently in those two cases.
           In immediate mode, if our own display list contents are invalid, we have to recompile it (without
        executing it) and only later emit the call, since compiling it is the only way to find out what other
        display lists it currently calls (when using the current widget expr .draw() API). Further, whether
        or not we recompiled it, we have to make sure any other lists it calls are valid, recompiling them
        if not, even though they too might call other lists we can't discover until we recompile them.
           Since OpenGL doesn't permit nested compiles of display lists, we use a helper function:
        given a set of display lists, make sure all of them are ok to call (by compiling zero or more of them,
        one at a time), extending this set recursively to all lists they indirectly call, as found out when
        recompiling them. This involves calling .draw methods of arbitrary widgets, with a glpane flag telling
        them we're compiling a display list. (In fact, we tell them its controller object, e.g. self,
        so they can record info that helps with later redrawing them for highlighting or transparency.)
           When not in immediate mode, it means we're inside the recursive algorithm described above,
        which is compiling some other display list that calls us. We can safely emit our glCallList before or after
        our other effects (since it's not executed immediately), but we also have to add ourselves to
        the set of displists directly called by whatever list is being compiled. (Doing that allows the
        recursive algorithm to add those to the set it needs to check for validity. That alg can optim by
        only doing that to the ones we know might be invalid, but it has to record them as sublists of
        the list being compiled whether or not we're valid now, since it might use that later when we're
        no longer valid.)
           We do all that via methods and/or private dynamic vars in self.glpane. ###doc which
           Note that the recursive algorithm may call us more than once. We should, of course, emit a glCallList
        every time, but get recompiled by the recursive algorithm at most once, whether that happens due to side effects
        here or in the algorithm or both. (Both might be possible, depending on what optims are implemented. ###k)
           Note that recursive display list calls are possible
        (due to bugs in client code), even though they are OpenGL errors if present when executed. (BTW, it's possible
        for cycles to exist transiently in display list contents without an error, if this only happens when
        some but not all display lists have been updated after a change. This needs no noticing or handling in the code.)
