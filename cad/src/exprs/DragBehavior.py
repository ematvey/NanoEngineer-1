A DragBehavior

is a behavior in response to drag events

that a Drawable (called a "drag handle") can be given
(in addition to whatever highlighting and cursor behavior it has)

and that determines how drag events affect a position or position-determining state

(one which maps to a position, perhaps constrained to a line or plane, and/or a region, and/or quantized)

which this behavior is used to drag, and which usually (in part)
determines the drawn position of the drag handle.
