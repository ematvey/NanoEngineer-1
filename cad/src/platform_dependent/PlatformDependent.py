PlatformDependent.py -- module for platform-specific utilities and constants.

Also includes various code that might conceivably vary by platform,
but mainly is here since it had no better place to live. In fact, by 060106
most of its code is like that, and a lot of it has something to do with messages
or the screen or files, that is, issues having to do with both the UI and the
OS interface.

    Every mouse event's button and modifier key flags should be
    filtered through this method (actually just a "method helper function").

    Arguments:
    
    - self can be the client object; we use it only for storing state
      between calls, namely, self._fix_buttons_saved_buttons.
      The caller need no longer init that to 0.
      
    - 'but' should be the flags from event.stateAfter() or
      event.state(), whichever ones would have the correct set of
      mousebuttons -- this depends on the type of event; see the
      usage in GLPane for an example.
      
    - 'when' should be 'press', 'move', or 'release', according
      to how this function should treat the buttons and modifier keys --
      it will record them for press, and then maintain the same
      ones (in its return value) for move or release, regardless
      of what the real modifier keys and buttons did.

    Returns: a new version of 'but' which is simpler for client code
    to use correctly (as described below).

    Known bugs [as of 050113]: reportedly prints warnings, and perhaps
    has wrong results, when dialogs intercept some "release" events.
    (Or am I confusing these rumors with ones about key-releases?)
    Should be easy to fix given a repeatable example.
    
    More details: this function does two things:

    1. Store all button and modifier-key flags from a mouse-press,
    and reuse them on the
    subsequent mouse-drag and mouse-release events (but not on
    pure mouse-moves), so the caller can just switch on the flags
    to process the event, and will always call properly paired
    begin/end routines (this matters if the user releases or
    presses a modifier key during the middle of a drag; it's
    common to release a modifier key then).

    2. On the Mac, remap
    Option+Qt.LeftButton to middleButton, so that the Option key
    (also called the Alt key) simulates the middle mouse button.
    (Note that Qt/Mac, by default, lets Control key simulate
    rightButton and remaps Command key to the same flag we call
    cntlButton; we like this and don't change it here.
    In Qt4.2.2/Mac, the Control key is no longer simulating right button --
    in fact, right button is simulating control key! So we fix that here.)
