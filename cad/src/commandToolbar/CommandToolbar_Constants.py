Module classification: [bruce 071228]

This is used only in Ui_CommandToolbar, slated for "ne1_ui" package.
But when we refactor Ui_CommandToolbar as described in its docstring,
this will end up used only by the part that goes into the toplevel
"CommandToolbar" package. So we might as well classify it there now.


History:
