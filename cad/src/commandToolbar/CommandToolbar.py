Module classification: [bruce 071228]

This mainly contains control logic (especially regarding flyout
toolbar behavior and appearance) for any hierarchical
command toolbar which operates like NE1's main Command Toolbar.

Accordingly, after future refactoring, it could be part of a
general-purpose "command toolbar widget" package. But at the
moment, it inherits a hardcoding of NE1's specific Command Toolbar
layout and contents, via its superclass Ui_CommandToolbar,
which is what actually needs to be refactored.

So we have two imperfect choices for classifying it:

(1) put it in ne1_ui just because of its superclass; or

(2) classify it as a widget independent of ne1_ui,
but tolerate an import in it from ne1_ui for now,
until the superclass gets refactored (which might
not happen soon).

I think it's best to classify it "optimisitically"
using scheme (2), and let the wrong-direction import
remind us that the superclass needs refactoring.

I am assuming that will cause no inter-package import cycle,
since no cycle has been reported involving this module.

So for now, the superclass is in "ne1_ui", but this module
can go into its own toplevel "CommandToolbar" package.
(Not just into "widgets" or a subpackage, since it is a major
component of an app, and might still assume it's a singleton
or have client code which assumes that. In future, we can
consider making the general part non-singleton and putting
it into its own subpackage of "widgets".)

After future refactoring of the superclass Ui_CommandToolbar
(described in its module classification comment), its general
part would join this module as part of the same package
for a "general command toolbar widget".

BTW, I think it should be the case, and might already
be the case, that whatever state this class needs to help
maintain (even given its not-yet-refactored superclass)
will actually reside in the Command Sequencer and/or
in running commands, along with the logic for how
to modify that state. This class's object is just the
UI that makes the Command Sequencer state visible
and user-controllable.

BTW2, another needed refactoring (perhaps more related
to Ui_CommandToolbar than to this module) is to make
sure commands don't need to update their own UI elements
in various ways; for more on this see

History:

ninad 20070109: created this in QT4 branch and subsequently modified it.
ninad 20070125: moved ui generation code to a new file Ui_CommandManager
ninad 20070403: implemented 'Subcontrol Area'  in the command toolbar, related 
             changes (mainly revised _updateFlyoutToolBar,_setFlyoutDictionary) 
             and added/modified several docstrings  
ninad 20070623: Moved _createFlyoutToolbar from modes to here and related changes
mark 20071226: Renamed CommandManager to CommandToolbar.

ninad 20080715: a) Workaround for Qt4.3 bug 2916 (disabled 'extension indicator'
 button ">>" in the flyout toolbar.  b) some refactoring to  move common code 
 in classes FlyoutToolbar and NE1_QWidgetAction.

    Command Toolbar is the big toolbar above the 3D graphics area and
