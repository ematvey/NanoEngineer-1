HistoryWidget.py -- provides a Qt "megawidget" supporting our history/status area.

TODO:

This file ought to be extensively revised or reorganized, possibly along
with all code that calls it (e.g. any code that generates status messages).

The history code itself (as opposed to the UI code in the megawidget)
should be split into a separate module when it gets complicated.

In fact, it should be split into a few cooperating objects (archive, widget,
file io, storage ops), in separate files. [bruce 080104 comment]

Terminology:

A "megawidget" is an object, not itself a widget, which controls
one or more widgets so as to act like a single more complex widget. I got the
term from "Python Megawidgets" (which are implemented in Tk rather than Qt).

        but use semi-heuristics to decide how to combine this text with previous "status text"
        so that the recorded history is not too full of redundant messages.

        [Some of these features might be in _print_msg rather than in this method directly.]
           If transient_id is supplied, then for successive messages for which it's the same,
        put them all in the conventional statusbar, but only print the last one into the widget.

        by client code, a msg of None or "" is permitted and ignored. [#e also clear statusbar then?])
           When transient_id is supplied, repaint = 1 tries to repaint the statusbar after modifying it.

        with forms that will print as themselves. Note that this is not compatible with text
        returned by functions such as greenmsg; for that, you have to use quote_html(text) on appropriate
        portions of the message text. See also message_no_html.
           When quote_html is combined with transient_id, (I hope) it only affects the
        message printed to the history widget, not to the statusbar.
           If color is provided, it should be one of a fixed list of supported colors (see code for details),
        and it's applied after quote_html, and (I hope) only in the widget, not in the statusbar
