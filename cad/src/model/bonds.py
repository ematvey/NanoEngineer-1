History:

- originally by Josh

- lots of changes, by various developers

- split out of chem.py by bruce 050502

- support for higher-valence bonds added by bruce 050502 - ??? [ongoing]

- bruce optimized some things, including using 'is' and 'is not' rather than '==', '!='
  for atoms, molecules, elements, parts, assys in many places (not all commented individually); 050513

- bruce split bond_constants.py into a separate module; 050707

- 050727 bruce moved bond drawing code into a separate module, bond_drawer.py
  (also removed some imports not needed here, even though chem.py still does "from bonds import *"
   and some other modules import * from chem, so there is no guarantee these were not needed indirectly)

    WARNING: If vnew is not provided, this function behaves differently and is
    much less safe for general use (details below).
    
       Behavior when vnew is provided:
    Bond atoms a1 and a2 by making a new bond of order vnew (which must be one
    of the constants in chem.BOND_VALENCES, not a numerically expressed bond order;
    for the effect of not providing vnew, see below).
       The new bond is returned. If for some reason it can't be made, None is returned
    (but if that can happen, we should revise the API so an error message can be returned).
       Error if these two atoms are already bonded. [Question: is this detected? ###k]
       If provided, s1 and s2 are the existing singlets on a1 and a2 (respectively)
    whose valence (i.e. bond order code on their open bonds)
    should be reduced (or eliminated, in which case they are deleted)
    to provide valence (bond order) for the new bond. (If they don't have enough,
    other adjustments will be made; this function is free to alter, remove, or replace
    any existing singlets on either atom.)
       For now, this function will never alter the bond order of any existing bonds
    to real atoms. If necessary, it will introduce valence errors on a1 and/or a2.
    (Or if they already had valence errors, it might remove or alter those.)
       If no_corrections = True, this function will not alter singlets on a1 or a2,
    but will either completely ignore issues of total valence of these atoms, or will
    limit itself to tracking valence errors or setting related flags (this is undecided).
    (This might be useful for code which builds new atoms rather than modifying
    existing ones, such as when reading mmp files or copying existing atoms.)
       If no_corrections is false, and if the open bonds on s1 or s2 have directions set,
    not inconsistently, then if the new bond is directional, it's given a direction
    consistent with those open bonds (new feature 071017).

       Behavior when vnew is not provided (less safe in general):
    For backwards compatibility, when vnew is not provided, this function calls the
    old code [pre-higher-valence-bonds, pre-050502] which acts roughly as if
    vnew = V_SINGLE, s1 = s2 = None, no_corrections = True, except that it returns
    None rather than the newly made bond, and unlike this function doesn't mind
    if there's an existing bond, but does nothing in that case; this behavior might
    be relied on by the current code for copying bonds when copying a chunk, which
    might copy some of them twice.
       Using the old bond_atoms code by not providing vnew is deprecated,
    and might eventually be made impossible after all old calling code is converted
    for higher-order bonds. [However, as of 051216 it's still called in lots of places.]

    @warning: this docstring is partly obsolete.
    
    A Bond is essentially a record pointing to two atoms
    (either one of which might be a real atom or a "singlet"),
    representing a bond between them if it also occurs in atom.bonds
    for each atom. It should occur in both or neither of atom.bonds
    of its two atoms, except transiently.
       The two atoms in a bond should always be different objects.
       We don't support more than one bond between the same two
    atoms; trying to add the second one will do nothing, because
    of Bond.__eq__. We don't yet support double or triple bonds...
    but [bruce 050429 addendum] soon after Alpha 5 we'll start
    supporting those, and I'll start prototyping them right now --
    DO NOT COMMIT until post-Alpha5.
       Bonds have a private member 'key' so they can be compared equal
    whenever they involve the same pair of atoms (in either order).
       Bonds sometimes store geometric info used to draw them; see
    the method setup_invalidate, which must be called when the atoms
    are changed in certain ways. Bonds don't store any selection
    state or display-mode state, and they record no info about the
    bonded molecules (but each bonded atom knows its molecule).
       Bonds are called "external" if they connect atoms in two
    different molecules, or "internal" if they connect two atoms
    in the same molecule. This affects what kind of info is
    invalidated by the private method invalidate_bonded_mols, which
    should be called by internal code whenever the bond is actually
    added to or removed from its atoms
    (or is probably about to be added or removed).
       Bonds can be removed from their atoms by Bond.bust, and then
    forgotten about (no need to kill or otherwise explicitly destroy
    them after they're not on their atoms).

        # Notes / caveats / bugs:
        #
        # - ideally this would be generalized (to let atomtype decide whether
        #   and how to handle this).
        #
        # - the tests are thought to be in optimal order, but could be optimized
        #   more if the atomtype or element had better flags.
        #
        # - in theory we should do this for all monovalent elements, not just
        #   Singlet. In practice it doesn't matter, and there is not yet a flag
        #   for that, and len(atom.bonds) might not yet be up to date if atom
        #   is still being constructed. I guess atomtype.valence could be used.
        #
        # - in theory we should *not* do this for atoms being read from an mmp
        #   file (or any other trusted source of already-made structure, like
        #   when copying a partlib part or anything else), at least if this new
        #   bond is also read from that file or copied from that same source.
        #   In practice this would require a new argument flag (or the callers
        #   unsetting _f_dna_updater_should_reposition_baggage themselves --
        #   easy if we find them all, but a kluge), and worse, there are a lot
        #   of mmp files with incorrect bondpoint positions that we ought to
        #   fix! Nonetheless, except for that, it's a bug to do it then. If this
        #   is an issue, we'll fix the callers to unset this flag on the atoms
        #   that were just read or copied, unless they made their own bondpoints
        #   on them, or before they do so.
        #
        # - if for some reason the updater does not see this flag (probably
        #   only possible if the new bondpoint is later removed from the atom
        #   we set it on before it runs), no harm should be caused, even if
        #   it sees it much later on the same atom, since that only happens
        #   if the atom shows up at a ladder-end, and since it will verify
        #   it still has bondpoints before "fixing them", and if it got new
        #   ones then, that would have readded the same flag anyway. It does
        #   mean that turning on the updater after making an atom and manually
        #   moving its bondpoints would make it "correct" the manual moves,
        #   but that's ok since having the dna updater off is not supported.
