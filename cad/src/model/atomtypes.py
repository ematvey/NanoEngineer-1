History:

Bruce 050510 moved some code (originally by Josh)
out of Elem.__init__ into new class AtomType.__init__
and added all the superstructure, as part of supporting
atom types with variable bonding patterns
(and higher-order bonds, though as of 050511 these atoms
don't yet know anything directly about bond-orders
and their .valence attribute is probably not yet used [later: now it's used].)

bruce 050513 replaced some == with 'is' and != with 'is not', to avoid __getattr__
on __xxx__ attrs in python objects.

    An atom type includes an element and its bonding pattern (and maybe more) --
    enough info to know how to construct things in Build mode using this element in this bonding pattern,
    something about how the user wants to simulate them or minimize them (externally or wirthin Build mode),
    etc.
       This is designed more for the UI than for the simulator, which might need even finer distinctions
    to properly simulate atoms. The idea is to include in this class whatever the user needs for convenient
    building, and to later infer from the pattern of actual bonds and surrounding atoms (as well as the info
    in this object) how best to simulate an atom using this atomtype object.
       An atomtype object can be used alone to create a free or attached atom,
    and might also be kept around by the atom as its way of remembering its own type -- which might change.
    Or an atom might just remember the *name* of its atomtype
    (and grab this object from a list in the element) -- I don't know yet.
        ###obs, probably wrong: Note that (as far as is yet known) more than one identical atomtype object might exist -- so the object itself
    is not an ok place to store definitive mutable per-session info about how to treat that atom type.
       The name of an atomtype might be reused for more than one element (e.g. 'sp2')

           BTW [#obs, WRONG],
        an order of bond types from most to least permissible is (ignoring special rules for graphite, and sp2 O or S):
        single, double, aromatic/graphite, triple, carbomeric. [See also the constant tuple most_permissible_v6_first.]
        If a type in that list is not permitted for some atomtype, neither are all types beyond it

           Note: sp2 O and S disallow single bonds only because they have exactly one bond and a valence requirement of 2
        (at least that's one way of thinking about it). So this function permits single bonds for them, so that
        the error in e.g. H-O(sp2) can be considered a valence error on the O rather than a bond-type error.
        This way, the calling code is simpler, since all bonds have legal types just given the elements/atomtypes on them;
        valence errors can be handled separately at a later stage.
           (Similarly, this function would permit both S-S and S=S for diatomic S(sp2), though at later stages,
         neither is error-free, S-S due to valence errors and S=S due to extreme instability. BTW, for code simplicity
         I've decided that both those errors are "permitted but with warnings" (and the warnings might be NIM). That has
         nothing to do with this function specifically, it's just FYI.)

alternating with bonda, where the bond orders are 1.5, 2.5, 1.5, etc)
