History:

050429 - Started out as part of bonds.py. Gradually extended.

050707 - Split into separate file, largely to avoid recursive import problems
(since these constants need to be imported by many bond-related modules).
Many of them are still imported via bonds module, by code in other modules.

050920 - Full mmp support for Carbomeric bonds.
[FYI: As of today, sim executable reportedly accepts them and uses same params
as for bond2.]

# Here's an old long comment which is semi-obsolete now [050707], but which motivates the term "v6".
# Note that I'm gradually replacing the term "bond valence" with whichever of "bond order" or "bond type"
# (related but distinct concepts) is appropriate. Note also that all the bond orders we deal with in this code
# are "structural bond orders" (used by chemists to talk about bonding structure), not "physical bond orders"
# (real numbers related to estimates of occupancy of molecular orbitals by electrons).

#bruce 050429: preliminary plan for higher-valence bonds (might need a better term for that):
#
# - Bond objects continue to compare equal when on same pair of atoms (even if they have a
# different valence), and (partly by means of this -- probably it's a kluge) they continue
# to allow only one Bond between any two atoms (two real atoms, or one real atom and one singlet).
#
# - I don't think we need to change anything basic about "internal vs external bonds",
# coordinates, basic inval/draw schemes (except to properly draw new kinds of bonds),
# etc. (Well, not due to bond valence -- we might change those things for other reasons.)
#
# - Each Bond object has a valence. Atoms often sum the valences of their bonds
# and worry about this, but they no longer "count their bonds" -- at least not as a
# substitute for summing the valences. (To prevent this from being done by accident,
# we might even decide that their list of bonds is not really a list, at least temporarily
# while this is being debugged. #?)
#
# This is the first time bonds have any state that needs to be saved,
# except for their existence between their two atoms. This will affect mmpfile read/write,
# copying of molecules (which needs rewriting anyway, to copy jigs/groups/atomsets too),
# lots of things about depositMode, maybe more.
#
# - Any bond object can have its valence change over time (just as the coords,
# elements, or even identities of its atoms can also change). This makes it a lot
# easier to write code which modifies chemical structures in ways which preserve (some)
# bonding but with altered valence on some bonds.
#
# - Atoms might decide they fit some "bonding pattern" and reorder
# their list of bonds into a definite order to match that pattern (this is undecided #?).
# This might mean that code which replaces one bond with a same-valence bond should do it
# in the same place in the list of bonds (no idea if we even have any such code #k).
#
# - We might also need to "invalidate an atom's bonding pattern" when we change anything
# it might care about, about its bonds or even its neighboring elements (two different flags). #?
#
# - We might need to permit atoms to have valence errors, either temporarily or permanently,
# and keep track of this. We might distinguish between "user-permitted" or even "user-intended"
# valence errors, vs "transient undesired" valence errors which we intend to automatically
# quickly get rid of. If valence errors can be long-lasting, we'll want to draw them somehow.
# 
# - Singlets still require exactly one bond (unless they've been killed), but it can have
# any valence. This might affect how they're drawn, how they consider forming new bonds
# (in extrude, fuse chunks, depositMode, etc), and how they're written into sim-input mmp files.
#
# - We represent the bond valence as an integer (6 times the actual valence), since we don't
# want to worry about roundoff errors when summing and comparing valences. (Nor to pay the speed
# penalty for using exactly summable python objects that pretend to have the correct numeric value.)
#
# An example of what we don't want to have to worry about:
#
#   >>> 1/2.0 + 1/3.0 + 1/6.0
#   0.99999999999999989
#   >>> _ >= 1.0
#   False
#
# We do guarantee to all code using these bond-valence constants that they can be subtracted
# and compared as numbers -- i.e. that they are "proportional" to the numeric valence.
# Some operations transiently create bonds with unsupported values of valence, especially bonds
# to singlets, and this is later cleaned up by the involved atoms when they update their bonding
# patterns, before those bonds are ever drawn. Except for bugs or perhaps during debugging,
# only standard-valence bonds will ever be drawn, or saved in files, or seen by most code.
