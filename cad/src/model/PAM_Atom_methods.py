History:

bruce 080327 split out of chem.py class Atom,
in which these methods had been written

TODO:

REVIEW whether any of these methods are sometimes called on non-PAM atoms,
always doing nothing or returning a null value, e.g. getDnaBaseName.

also refactor some code that remains in chem.py but has
PAM-element-specific sections, like the transmute context menu
entries for PAM elements, and some bond_geometry_error_string things
(which needs a separate refactoring first, for other reasons)
"""

# WARNING: this module is imported by chem.py and therefore indirectly by
# chunk.py. Therefore its import dependence on other things needs to be
# minimized, especially toplevel imports of dna model and updater code.
# We'll let it import from pam3plus5_math and maybe pam3plus5_ops
# and keep those clean as well, until all this can be cleared up.
# (The ultimate issue is having PAM-specific methods on class Atom,
#  as opposed to on a PAM-specific subclass of class Atom.)

    # The Atom methods below this point might be moved into subclasses for
    # specific types of atoms.

    #  until old code is fully revised to only call them on the subclasses.)

        a chain that covers both bonds so the user can set the entire

        almost-independent directional_bond_chain_status (due to the
        possibility of erroneous structures), so both of its atoms

        To make it a live atom, special methods must be called [nim]
