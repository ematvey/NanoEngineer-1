Note, 070414: it turns out a lot of the same concepts and similar code
ought to be useful for keeping track of chains of "directional bonds"
(such as pseudo-atom DNA backbones) in which direction-inference
and consistency checks should occur. Maybe I'll even create a general class
for perceiving bond-chains (or rings), with subclasses which know
about specific ways of recognizing bonds they apply to; or a class
whose instances hold bond-classifiers and act as perceivers of chains
of bonds of that type. (Once the chain is perceived, by generic code,
it does need specific code for its chain-type to figure out what to
do, though the basic fact of being destroyed when involved-atom-structure
changes is probably common. In the bond direction case, unlike in PiBondSpChain,
destroying the perceived strand will leave behind some persistent state,
namely the per-bond directions themselves; the perceived strand's role
is to help change those directions in an organized way.)

#bruce 060223: How will we (PiBondSpChain) deal with Undo? We could just store every attr in this object, but we don't want to bother.
# We want to think of it as entirely derived from other state (as it in fact is). So if things change, we'd rather invalidate it
# and start over. In theory that should be ok, provided Undo (when changing other atoms & bonds) invals them in all the same
# ways their LL change methods would do, including telling this object they changed (which makes it destroy itself).
# Since this is a Jig, it will at least participate in Jigs' scheme for having atom lists and being on atoms' jig lists,
# and Undo ought to properly handle that... how does that interact with our own policy of destroying ourself as soon as some atom
# we're interested in says it changed? Could that happen with atom->jig and jig->atom connections not yet corresponding?
# Solution to that worry: first let Undo do all its setattrs (so atom->jig and jig->atom connections have all been changed),
# then call all object updaters at once. Ours is our superclass's and does nothing (I think); the one on the first atom we
# encounter will destroy us; this will remove us from an atom's jig list but that should not (I think) invalidate the atom,
# since those are really just "back pointers" rather than properties of the atom (if it did inval it, that would be bad, I think --
# maybe not, since _undo_update is really an inval method and those can in general call other inval methods).
#  So if Atom & Bond _undo_updates are correct, we should be ok. If not, some bugs will be noticed at some point.
#
# One other thing: we're a Jig, but we're not in the node tree (which is why we don't get into mmp files). So Undo will not find us
# as a child object. We'll still get an objkey (I think)... hmm, this might be a problem, since when restoring some atom->jig to us,
# it won't restore our pointer to that atom. Can that ever happen (in light of our atomset being fixed)? I don't know. I think this
# might indeed cause bugs, so we might need to get counted as a child, or be some new undo-kind of object that easily gets
# invalidated by any _undo_update on atoms it touches (maybe we introduce "subscribe to another obj's _undo_update" or to their
# specific attrs?). I think it's easiest to wait and see if bugs happen. If they do, that subscription idea sounds best to me.
# CHANGED MY MIND, I'll just make us an S_CHILD of our bonds... then our atomset should be ok, and we could have _undo_update
# notice it changing too, if we wanted to. Let's do that for safety (maybe we'll never know if it was needed).
