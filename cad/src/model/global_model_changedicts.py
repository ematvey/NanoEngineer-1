global_model_changedicts.py - global changedicts needed by master_model_updater
or the specific update functions it calls. These are public for access
and modification by those update functions, and for additions by all
low-level model-modification code.

TODO:

Maybe make their global names (here) and localvar names (in specific update functions) differ.

Maybe let them be created by changedict objects,
from which we'll assign them to these same globals?

This would also facilitate their use in ways that are
protected from undetected changes during their use,
related to how Undo uses its changedicts, but swapping
in new subscribing dicts each time an old one needs
to be looked at.

Maybe let them be attributes of one singleton object?

Related -- integrate these with the Undo changedicts
and in some cases reuse the same ones (subscribe to
them in master_model_updater or its update functions).

(For what to do to be clear, we need to see the details
of how higher-level updaters ever need to repeat lower-level
ones.)


History:

bruce 050627 started this as part of supporting higher-order bonds.

bruce 071108 split this out of bond_updater.py (which also got
split into itself and master_model_updater.py).
