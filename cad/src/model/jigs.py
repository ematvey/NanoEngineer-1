History:

Mostly written as gadgets.py (I'm not sure by whom);
renamed to jigs.py by bruce 050414; jigs.py 1.1 should be an
exact copy of gadgets.py rev 1.72,
except for this module-docstring and a few blank lines and comments.

bruce 050507 pulled in the jig-making methods from class Part.

bruce 050513 replaced some == with 'is' and != with 'is not',
to avoid __getattr__ on __xxx__ attrs in python objects.

bruce circa 050518 made rmotor arrow rotate along with the atoms.

050927 moved motor classes to jigs_motors.py and plane classes to jigs_planes.py

mark 051104 Changed named of Ground jig to Anchor.

bruce 080305 changed Jig superclass from Node to NodeWith3DContents
