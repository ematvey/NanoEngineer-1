BorrowerChunk.py -- a chunk which temporarily borrows the atoms
from another one, for an experimental optimization of display lists
when moving subsets of the atoms of a chunk.

Not used by default. Deprecated, since some more principled and
more general loosening of the chunk <-> display list correspondence
would be much better.

# Some notes about BorrowerChunk [bruce 060411]
##    If an undo checkpoint occurs while the atoms are stolen,
##    it won't contain them (it will be as if they were deleted, I think).
##    This might be tolerable for A7 (if tested for safety), since cp's during drag
##    are rare -- or it might not, if problems are caused by bonds from existing to dead atoms!
##
##    When we want to fix it, here are some possible ways:
#     - make the missing-atoms scheme work, by making the bonds from existing to dead atoms also seem to be missing, somehow.
##    - let this chunk be scanned by Undo (ie make it a child of the assy, in a special place
##    so not in the MT), and let it have an _undo_update method
##    (or the like) which merges its atoms back into their homes. (It might turn out this is required
##    anyway, if having it missing during a cp causes unforseen problems.)
##    - disable cp's during drag.
##    - merge undo diffs from the drag.

class BorrowerChunk(Chunk):
    """
    A temporary Chunk (mostly transparent to users and Undo, when not added to MT) whose atoms belong in other chunks.
    Useful for optimizing redraws, since it has one perhaps-small display list, and the other chunks' display lists
    won't be modified when our atoms change (except once when we first steal their atoms, and when we add them back).

    @warning: removing atoms from, or adding atoms to, this pseudo-chunk is not supported.
    Except for debugging purposes, it should never be added to the MT, or permitted to exist when arbitrary user-ops are possible.
    Its only known safe usage pattern is to be created, used, and destroyed, during one extended operation such as a mouse-drag.
    [If more uses are thought of, these limitations could all be removed. #e]

    update 060412: trying to make it fully safe for Undo cp, and in case it's accidently left alive (in GLPane or MT).
    But not trying to make results perfectly transparent or "correct" in those cases, since we'll try to prevent them.
    E.g. for mmp save, it'll save as a normal Chunk would.
