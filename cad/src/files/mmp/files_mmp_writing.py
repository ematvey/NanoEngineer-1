bruce 080304 split this out of files_mmp.py.

bruce 080328 split mmpformat_versions.py out of this file.

Note:

A lot of mmp writing code is defined in other files,
notably (but not only) for the classes Chunk, Atom, and Jig.

For notes about mmp file format version strings,
including when to change them and a list of all that have existed,
see other files in this package.
