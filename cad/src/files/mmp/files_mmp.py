History:

bruce 050414 pulled this out of fileIO.py, cvs rev. 1.97
(of which it was the major part),
since I am splitting that into separate modules for each file format.

bruce 080304 split out the mmp writing part into its own file,
files_mmp_writing.py. That also contains the definition of
MMP_FORMAT_VERSION_TO_WRITE and the history of its values
and refers to the documentation for when to change it.
[Later that stuff was moved to mmpformat_versions.py.]

bruce 080304 split out the registration code, to avoid import cycles,
since anything should be able to import that, but the main reading code
(remaining in this file) needs to import a variety of model classes
for constructing them (since not everything uses the registration scheme
or should have to).

            # Inserted mainpart might contain jigs whose atoms were in clipboard of inserted file.
            #   Internally, right now, those atoms exist, in legitimate chunks in assy
            # (with a chain of dads going up to 'shelf' (the localvar above), which has no dad),
            # and have not been killed. Bug 563 concerns these jigs being inserted with no provision
            # for their noninserted atoms. It's not obvious what's best to do in this case, but a safe
            # simple solution seems to be to pretend to insert and then delete the shelf we just read,
            # thus officially killing those atoms, and removing them from those jigs, with whatever
            # effects that might have (e.g. removing those jigs if all their atoms go away).
            #   (When we add history messages for jigs which die from losing all atoms,
            # those should probably differ in this case and in the usual case,
            # but those are NIM for now.)
            #   I presume it's ok to kill these atoms without first inserting them into any Part...
            # at least, it seems unlikely to mess up any specific Part, since they're not now in one.
