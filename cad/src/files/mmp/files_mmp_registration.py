History:

bruce 080304 split this out of files_mmp.py, to avoid import cycles,
since anything should be able to import this module, but the main
reading code (which remains in files_mmp) needs to import a variety
of model classes for constructing them (since not everything uses
the registration scheme or should have to).

class MMP_RecordParser(object): #bruce 071018
    """
    Public superclass for parsers for reading specific kinds of mmp records.

    Concrete subclasses should be registered with the global default
    mmp grammar using

      register_MMP_RecordParser('recordname', recordParser)
    
    for one or more recordnames which that parser subclass can support.
    
    Typically, each subclass knows how to parse just one kind of record,
    and is registered with only one recordname.

    Instance creation is only done by the mmp parser module,
    at least once per assembly (the instance will know which assembly
    it's for in self.assy, a per-instance constant), and perhaps
    as often as once per mmp file read (or conceivably even once
    per mmp record read -- REVIEW whether to rule that out in order
    to permit instances to remember things between records while
    one file is being read, e.g. whether they've emitted certain
    warnings, and similarly whether to promise they're instantiated
    once per file, as opposed to less often, for the same reason).

    Concrete subclasses need to define method read_record,
    which will be called with one line of text
    (including the final newline) whose first word
    is one of the record names for which that subclass was
    registered.

    ### REVIEW: will they also be called for subsequent lines
    in some cases? motors, atoms/bonds, info records...

    The public methods in this superclass can be called by
    the subclass to help it work; their docstrings contain
    essential info about how to write concrete subclasses.
