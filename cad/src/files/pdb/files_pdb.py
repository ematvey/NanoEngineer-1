files_pdb.py -- reading and writing PDB files

History:

This was part of fileIO.py,
until bruce 050414 started splitting that
into separate modules for each file format.

bruce 070410 added some hacks to read more pdb files successfully --
but they need review by someone who knows whether they're correct or not.
(I'll commit this to both branches, Qt3 & Qt4, since this file is presently
identical in both, so doing that should not cause a problem.)
