History:

Bruce 050805 started this module.

Module classification, and refactoring needed:

Needs splitting into at least two files. One of them is some widgets
or widget helpers. The other is some "connect with state" facilities.
Those might be used for pure model state someday (with at least some
of them getting classified in foundation and used in model), but for now,
they are probably only used with widgets, so we might get away with
calling this a "ui/widgets" module without splitting it -- we'll see.

# still needed:
# - StateRef_API, in an appropriate file.
# - state APIs, objects, maybe exprs... obj-with-state-attr apis...
# - refactor above to take the widget with known signal/setter as its own class, maybe... not sure...
# we know each widget needs special case, so maybe fine to do those as subclasses... or as new methods on existing widget subclasses...
# review how to do that
# - code to put at most one of these on one widget - can be grabbed from above - helper function, for use in methods
#   problem - might need two funcs, one to clear, one to add. since order should be clear (to deactivate), make (activates), add,
#   so never two active at once.

#### REVIEW: should we rename connectWithState setStateConnection or something else with set,
# to match setAction?
