History:
2008-08-04 Created to aid command stack refactoring. 


TODO: 2008-08-04
- cleanup after command toolbar refactoring. 
- more documentation,
- have more flyouts use this new superclass

@see: Ui_PartLibraryFlyout (a subclass)

REVIEW: should this be moved into the widgets package? [bruce 080827 question]
-- This doesn't 'create a widget' so it shouldn't. But the current pkg location
for all UI_*Flyout modules  needs to be reconsidered [Ninad 2008-09-10]

        See BuildDnaFlyout, BuildAtomsFlyout for example.

        FlyoutToolbar_class. In such cases, it is called whenever command is 
        entered or resumed.
        
        Example: When its the default DNA command, this method resets all the 
        actions in the flyout toolbar except the 'ExitModeAction'. When
        it is the 'Build Atoms' command, the default state of the toolbar
        is such that the 'Atoms tool' button in the subcontrol area is checked
        along with the 'Exit' button. 
                           
        Example: If Insert > Dna command is exited and the Build > Dna command
        is resumed. When this happens, program needs to make sure that the 
        Insert > DNA button in the flyout is unchecked. It is done by using this
