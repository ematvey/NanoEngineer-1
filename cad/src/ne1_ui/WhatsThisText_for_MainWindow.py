WhatsThisText_for_MainWindow.py

This file provides functions for setting the "What's This" and tooltip text
for widgets in the NE1 Main Window, except widgets in Property Managers.

Edit WhatsThisText_for_PropertyManagers.py to set "What's This" and tooltip
text for widgets in the NE1 Property Managers.

@copyright: 2004-2008 Nanorex, Inc.  See LICENSE file for details.

Note: bruce 080210 split whatsthis_utilities.py out of this file
into their own new file. 

To do:
- Change the heading for all Display Style actions from "Display <ds>" to
"Apply <ds> Display Style to the selection". Change tooltips and wiki help
pages as well.
- Replace current text string name with "_text" (like "Open File" example)
