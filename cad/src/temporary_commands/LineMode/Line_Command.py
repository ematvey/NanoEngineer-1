History:
Split this out of LineMode.py (and deprecated that class)

TODOs:
- Refactor/ expand snap code. Should all the snapping code be in its own module?
- Need to discuss and derive various snap rules 
  Examples: If 'theta_snap' between dragged line and the  two reference enties 
            is the same, then the snap should use the entity with shortest  
            distance
            Should horizontal/vertical snap checks always be done before 
            standard axis  snap checks -- guess-- No. The current implementation
            however skips the standard axis snap check if the 
            horizontal/vertical snap checks succeed.
