Also intended as a prototype of code which could constitute the nE-1 side
of a "generator plugin API". Accordingly, the CoNTub-specific code should
as much as possible be isolated into small parts of this, with most of it
knowing nothing about CoNTub's specific functionality or parameters.

# how to test this: execute this in a debugger:
'''
import commands.InsertHeterojunction.CoNTubGenerator as CoNTubGenerator
reload(CoNTubGenerator)
'''
# Each time you do that, Insert menu gets a new command "Heterojunction". The first one is always the latest one.
