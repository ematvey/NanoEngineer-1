History:

by bruce, 040924/041011/041015... 050107...

ninad 070110: retired extrude dashboard  (in Qt4 branch). It was
replaced with its 'Property Manager' (see Ui_ExtrudePropertyManager,
ExtrudePropertyManager)

ninad 20070725: code cleanup to create a propMgr object for extrude mode.
Moved many ui helper methods to class ExtrudePropertyManager .

Ninad 2008-09-22: ported ExtrudeMode class to use new command API 
(developed in August - September 2008) .

TODO as of 2008-09-22:
Extrude mode is a class developed early days of NanoEngineer-1. Lots of things
have changed since then (example: Qt framework, major architectural changes etc) 
In genral it needs a major cleanup. Some items are listed below:
- split it into command/GM parts
- refactor and move helper functions in this file into their own modules. 
- several update methods need to be in central update methods in command 
  and PM classes
