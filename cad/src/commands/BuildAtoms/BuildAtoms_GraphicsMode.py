BuildAtoms_GraphicsMode.py 

The GraphicsMode part of the BuildAtoms_Command. It provides the  graphicsMode 
object for its Command class. The GraphicsMode class defines anything related to
the *3D Graphics Area* -- 
For example: 
- Anything related to graphics (Draw method), 
- Mouse events
- Cursors, 
- Key bindings or context menu

TODO: [as of 2008-01-04]
- Items mentioned in Select_GraphicsMode.py 
- Some items mentioned in BuildAtoms_Command.py 

History:
Originally as 'depositMode.py' by Josh Hall and then significantly modified by 
several developers. 
In January 2008, the old depositMode class was split into new Command and 
GraphicsMode parts and the these classes were moved into their own module
