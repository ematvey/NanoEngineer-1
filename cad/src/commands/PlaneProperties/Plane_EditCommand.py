History:
ninad 20070606: Created.
ninad 2007-10-05: Refactored, Also renamed PlaneGenerator to Plane_EditCommand
                  while refactoring the old GeometryGeneratorBaseClass
ninad 2007-12-26: Changes to make Plane_EditCommand a command on command stack



@TODO 2008-04-15:
Note that Plane_EditCommand was originally implemented before the command 
sequencer was operational. This class and its Property Manager has some methods 
that need cleanup to matchup with the command/commandsequencer API. 
e.g. in its PM, the method update_props_if_needed_before_closing need to be 
revised because there is any easy way now, to know which command is currently 
active.Also a general clanup is due -- Ninad
