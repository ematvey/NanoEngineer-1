By Mark.

bruce 050426 revising it, for Alpha5, mostly to fix bugs and perhaps to generalize it.
Adding various comments and revising docstrings; perhaps not signing every such change.
(Most movie code revisions will be in other files, and most revisions here will
 probably just be to adapt this file to the external changes.)

ninad20070507: moved Movie Player dashboard to Movie Property Manager.
ninad2008-08-21: Cleanup: a) to introduce command_enter/exit_* methods in the 
                  new Command API b) Moved flyouttoolbar related code in its own
