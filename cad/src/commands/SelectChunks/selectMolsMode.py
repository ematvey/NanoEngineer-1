Ninad 2007-02-16:   Split class selectMolsMode out of selectMode.py
Ninad & Bruce 2007-12-13: Created new Command and GraphicsMode classes from
                          the old class selectMolsMode moving them into
                          their own module [ See SelectChunks_Command.py and

        NOTE: This needs to be a general API method. There are situations when
        user enters a temporary mode , does something there and returns back to
        the previous mode he was in. He also needs some data that he gathered
        in that temporary mode so as to use it in the original mode he was
        working on. Here is a good example:
        -  User is working in selectMolsMode, Now he enters a temporary mode
        called DnaLine mode, where, he clicks two points in the 3Dworkspace
        and expects to create a DNA using the points he clicked as endpoints.
        Internally, the program returns to the previous mode after two clicks.
        The temporary mode sends this information to the method defined in
        the previous mode called acceptParamsFromTemporaryMode and then the
        previous mode (selectMolsMode) can use it further to create a dna

        - This needs to be a more general method in Command API.
