PasteMode.py

PasteMode allows depositing clipboard items into the 3D workspace. 
Its property manager lists the'pastable' clipboard items and also shows the 
current selected item in its 'Preview' box. User can return to previous mode by 
hitting 'Escape' key or pressing 'Done' button in the Paste mode.
