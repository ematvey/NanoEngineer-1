PartLibrary_Command.py 

Class PartLibrary_Command allows depositing parts from the partlib into the 3D 
workspace.Its property manager shows the current selected part in its 'Preview' 
box. The part can be deposited by doubleclicking on empty space in 3D workspace 
or if it has a hotspot, it can be deposited on a bondpoint of an existing model.  
User can return to previous mode by hitting  'Escape' key or pressing 'Done' 
button in the Part Library mode.

History:
The Partlib existed as a tab in the MMKit of Build Atoms Command. (MMKit has been 
deprecated since 2007-08-29.) Now it has its own temporary mode. 

ninad 2007-09-06: Created. Split out some methods originally in depositMode.py 
                  to this file.
