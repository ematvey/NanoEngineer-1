History: 
ninad 2007-09-06 Created to support the Partlib mode. This could be a temporary 
                 implementation. See Note below. 

NOTE:
In a future release, B{partlib} needs its own widget in the MainWindow like seen 
in popular cad softwares. (it probably shouldn't be in a Property manager).
