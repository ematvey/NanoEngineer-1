selectMode.py -- Select Chunks and Select Atoms modes,
also used as superclasses for some other modes

$Id: selectMode.py 11951 2008-03-14 04:44:50Z ericmessick $

Some things that need cleanup in this code [bruce 060721 comment]: ####@@@@

- redundant use of glRenderMode (see comment where that is used)

- division between selectMode and selectAtomsMode

- drag algorithms for various object types and modifier keys are split over
lots of methods with lots of common but not identical code. For example, a
set of atoms and jigs can be dragged in the same way, by two different
pieces of code depending on whether an atom or jig in the set was clicked
on. If this was cleaned up, so that objects clicked on would answer
questions about how to drag them, and if a drag_handler object was created
to handle the drag (or the object itself can act as one, if only it is
dragged and if it knows how), the code would be clearer, some bugs would be
easier to fix, and some NFRs easier to implement. [bruce 060728 -- I'm
adding drag_handlers for use by new kinds of draggable or buttonlike things
(only in selectAtoms mode and subclasses), but not changing how old dragging
code works.]

- Ninad 070216 moved selectAtomsMode and selectMolsMode out of selectMode.py
