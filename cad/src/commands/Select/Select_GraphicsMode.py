Select_GraphicsMode.py
The GraphicsMode part of the Select_Command. It provides the graphicsMode
object for its Command class. The GraphicsMode class defines anything
related to the *3D Graphics Area* --
For example:
- Anything related to graphics (Draw method),
- Mouse events
- Cursors,
- Key bindings or context menu

TODO:
-  Select_basicGraphicsMode is the main GM class. It is inherited by
    a 'glue-in' class Select_GraphicsMode. See cad/doc/splitting_a_mode.py for
    a detailed explanation on how this is used. Note that the glue-in classes
    will be used until all the selectMode subclasses are split into GM
    and Command part. Once thats done you the class Select_basicGraphicsMode
    needs to be used (and rename that to Select_GraphicsMode)
-  See if context menu related method makeMenus defined in the command class
    needs to be moved to the GraphicsMode class
-  Other items listed in Select_Command.py
-  Redundant use of glRenderMode (see comment where that is used) See Bruce's
  comments in method get_jig_under_cursor

OLD comment -- might be outdated as of 2007-12-13
Some things that need cleanup in this code [bruce 060721 comment]: ####@@@@

- drag algorithms for various object types and modifier keys are split over
lots of methods with lots of common but not identical code. For example, a
set of atoms and jigs can be dragged in the same way, by two different
pieces of code depending on whether an atom or jig in the set was clicked
on. If this was cleaned up, so that objects clicked on would answer
questions about how to drag them, and if a drag_handler object was created
to handle the drag (or the object itself can act as one, if only it is
dragged and if it knows how), the code would be clearer, some bugs would be
easier to fix, and some NFRs easier to implement. [bruce 060728 -- I'm
adding drag_handlers for use by new kinds of draggable or buttonlike things
(only in selectAtoms mode and subclasses), but not changing how old dragging
code works.]

History:
Ninad & Bruce 2007-12-13: Created new Command and GraphicsMode classes from
                          the old class selectMode and moved the GraphicsMode
                          related methods into this class from selectMode.py

        so that paintGL will run soon and will update it properly, and will
        highlight it if desired ###@@@ how is that controlled? probably by
        some statevar in self, passed to gl flag?

        This means that old code which depends on selatom being  up-to-date must
        do one of two things:
            - compute selatom from selobj, whenever it's needed;
            - hope that paintGL runs some callback in this mode when it changes
              selobj, which updates selatom and outputs whatever statusbar
