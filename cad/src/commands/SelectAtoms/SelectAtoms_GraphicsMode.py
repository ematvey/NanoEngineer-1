        # simplification:
        # [this comment and the partly redundant ones in the code will be
        # merged later]
        # - treat general case as smooth reshaping with different (trivial)
        # motion-function (though we'll optimize for that)
        # -- gather the same setup data either way. That will reduce
        # bug-differences between smooth reshaping and plain drags, and it might
        # help with other features in the future, like handling baggage better
        # when there are multiple selected atoms. - any baggage atom B has
        # exactly one neighbor S, and if that neighbor is selected(which is the
        # only time we might think of B as baggage here), we want B to move
        #   with S, regardless of smooth reshaping which might otherwise move
        #  them differently.
        #   This is true even if B itself is selected. So, for baggage atoms
        #  (even if selected) make a dict which points them to other selected
        # atoms. If we find cycles in that, those atoms must be closed for
        # selection (ie not indirectly bonded to unselected atoms, which is what
        # matters for smooth reshaping alg) or can be treated that way, so move
        # those atoms into a third dict for moving atoms which are not connected
        # to unmoving atoms.(These never participate in smooth reshaping
        # -- they always move
        #   with the drag.)
        # - the other atoms which move with the drag are the ones we find
        # later with N == N_max,
        #   and the other ones not bonded to unselected nonbaggage atoms,
        #   and all of them if
        #   we're not doing reshaping drag.
        # - then for all atoms which move with the drag (including some of
        #   the baggage,
        #   so rescan it to find those), we do the dragchunk optim;
        #   for the ones which move, but not with the drag, we store their
        #   motion-offset-ratio
        #   in a dict to be used during the drag (or maybe return it and let
        #   caller store it #k).
        #
        # - I think all the above can be simplified to the following:
        #   - expand selatoms to include baggage (then no need to remember
        #      which was which, since "monovalent" is good enough to mean
        #     "drag with neighbor", even for non-baggage)
        #   - point monovalent atoms in that set, whose neighbors are in it,
        #      to those neighbors(removing them from that set)
        #     (permitting cycles, which are always length 2)(during the drag,
        #      we'll move them with neighbors, then in future correct
        #      their posn for the motion of other atoms around those neighbors,
        #      as is now only done in single-atom dragging)
        #   - analyze remaining atoms in set for closeness (across bonds) to
        #     unselected atoms(permitting infinite dist == no connection to
        #     them)
        #   - then sort all the atoms into groups that move with the same
        #     offset, and find whole chunks in those groups (or at least in the
        #     group that moves precisely with the drag). (In future we'd use the
        #     whole-chunk and borrowerchunk optims (or equiv) for the
        #     slower-moving groups too. Even now, it'd be easy to use
        #     whole-chunk optim then, but only very rarely useful, so don't
        #     bother.)
        #
        # - finally, maybe done in another routine, selected movable jigs move
        #    in a way that depends on how
        #   their atoms move -- maybe their offset-ratio is the average of
        #   that of their atoms.
