SelectAtoms_Command.py 

The 'Command' part of the SelectAtoms Mode (SelectAtoms_basicCommand and 
SelectAtoms_basicGraphicsMode are the two split classes of the old 
selectAtomsMode)  It provides the command object for its GraphicsMode class. 
The Command class defines anything related to the 'command half' of the mode -- 
For example: 
- Anything related to its current Property Manager, its settings or state
- The model operations the command does (unless those are so simple
  that the mouse event bindings in the _GM half can do them directly
  and the code is still clean, *and* no command-half subclass needs
  to override them).

History:
Ninad & Bruce 2007-12-13: Created new Command and GraphicsMode classes from 
                          the old class selectAtomsMode and moved the 
                          Command related methods into this class from 
                          selectAtomsMode.py
