test_commands.py -- try out using mode classes as command classes for a command stack;
 find out the minimal needs for a command with PM (and improve them);
 prototype a command stack
 
@version: $Id: test_commands.py 14380 2008-09-30 17:30:40Z ninadsathaye $


How to run these test commands:

- set the debug_pref "test_commands enabled (next session)"

- quit and rerun NE1

- the debug menu's submenu "other" should contain new menu commands
defined in this file, such as ExampleCommand1. (Note: not all of them
are contiguous in that submenu, since the entire submenu is sorted
alphabetically.)


Cosmetic bugs:

- closing groupboxes makes them flash


TODO:

Split into several files in a subdirectory.

When cleaning up PropMgrBaseClass etc, note some other things Mark wants to work on soon:

- add message boxes to users of PropertyManagerMixin, in a way easily moved over to PropMgrBaseClass when they use that

- port more modes over to PropMgrBaseClass, e.g. extrudeMode

- split some PMs/modes into more than one smaller PM (especially MMKit). 
  Note: See PM_ElementSelector.py. Mark 2007-08-07.

Fix problems with _Example_TemporaryCommand_useParentPM (commented where it's used)
