test_connectWithState_constants.py -- constants for use in
test_connectWithState command and its PM.

This file can be merged into the command class, once it's possible
for the PM code to get these values directly from the staterefs
(an intended improvement).

# definitions for cylinder height and caps style, stored as preferences values
#
# (Note: in a realistic example, these would be defined using the State macro,
#  just as is done for the other state, below. The only reason they're defined
#  as preference values here is to illustrate how that kind of state can be used
#  interchangeably with State-macro-defined instance variables by connectWithState.)

# It could be referenced by the PM class in this file by:
# - self.commandrun.cylinderWidth
# - self.commandrun.cylinderColor (nim)
# - self.commandrun.cylinderVertical (###NIM)
# but in fact is referenced indirectly using string literals for those attr names.
