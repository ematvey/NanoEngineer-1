extensions.py

Note: for now, this is intentionally not imported (even indirectly or
conditionally) by main.py; see comment below for why. But it should
remain in this directory. [bruce 071005].

Someday: handle all our custom extension modules.

For now:
Python interface to experimental Pyrex code -- mainly just needs to fail gracefully
if its compiled form (a Python extension) is not there, or doesn't work in a drastic way.
In future, might also make sure it's up-to-date, tell you how to remake it if not,
and handle all extensions instead of just one or just Pyrex extensions.

This can't be called pyrex_test.py since then "import pyrex_test" would be ambiguous.
We want that to import the extension module... and this file might as well evolve
to try to handle all the extensions at once, so it gets a different more general name.

This fits the idea that this module contains only rarely-edited glue code,
with the real development action in the Pyrex source code (.pyx file).

For plans and status related to our use of Pyrex, see:

  http://www.nanoengineer-1.net/mediawiki/index.php?title=Integrating_Pyrex_into_the_Build_System

See README-Pyrex for the list of related files and their roles.

How to build:

% make pyx

(see also the wiki page listed above)

How to test:

[updated, bruce 071005, and retested on my Mac]

optional: in this source file, change debug_pyrex_test to True below.
But don't commit that change.

In NE1's run py code debug menu item, type "import extensions";
review the console prints for whether this succeeded;
then type "extensions.initialize()" and again review the console prints;
then use debug menu -> other -> count bonds.
If it failed, follow build instructions in README-Pyrex and/or pyrex_text.pyx.
(I don't know how similar your python environment needs to be to NE1's for that to work.)

Possible errors when you run "import extensions" or "extensions.initialize()":

ImportError: No module named pyrex_test -- you need to build it, e.g. "make pyx" in cad/src.

Fatal Python error: Interpreter not initialized (version mismatch?) -- this is
a Mac-specific problem related to the old bug 1724, caused by an interaction
between an Apple bug, a link error on our part, and having another Python
installed on your Mac -- typically in /Library/Frameworks. When this happens to
me, I can fix it by running the shell commands:

% cd /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions
% sudo mv 2.3 2.3-DISABLED

and rerunning NE1.

(That problem may occur, and the above fix works for me, whether I run NE1
directly as a developer or use the (Mac-specific) ALTERNATE_CAD_SRC_PATH
feature.)
