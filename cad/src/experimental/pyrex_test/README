a simple test of building and using pyrex code


this is what _import_roots.py said about these files
when they were at toplevel:

import extensions # a file optionally imported at runtime by NE1,
    # but which must not yet have an import statement in NE1
    # (since py2app/py2exe should not follow it for import dependencies,
    #  lest it get confused by the lack of the optional dll which
    #  this file tries to import)
    # [bruce 071008]

import setup # build script for the optional dlls loaded by extensions.py
    # (called from Makefile but not yet part of the NE1 build process)
    # [bruce 071008]



and this is what cad/src/Makefile said:

# bruce 051202 added this target
extensions: 
	python setup.py build_ext --inplace

pyx: extensions




extensions.py is also mentioned in startup_misc.py
