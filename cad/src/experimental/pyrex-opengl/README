------------------------------------

The code in the cad/src directory has been changed to expect the quux.so
library to be in cad/bin rather than this directory. If you are a developer
then you'll need to copy it to cad/bin manually. (Maybe I'll modify the
makefile to do this.)

This was for the benefit of release building. Later I will plan to change the
name 'quux' to something more informative like 'shapeRenderer' or some such.
This change will apply to both release builds and developer builds.

Refer to Bruce's email of Mar 15, 2006 4:06 PM for more ideas about what
might need to be changed.

How to test today's code:

    Assuming Python 2.3 or 2.4 installed

    Assuming OpenGL 1.1 or better installed

    On Windows:

        Install Dev-Cpp 4.9.9.2 (from http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html)
            If you are using "Cygwin" for anything, you may need to put
            /cygdrive/c/Dev-Cpp/Bin (or c:/Dev-Cpp/Bin, but not tested)
            in your $PATH before any Cygwin directories.
            (PATH=/cygdrive/c/Dev-Cpp/Bin:$PATH)

        Install Pyrex 0.9.3.1 (from http://nz.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/%7Egreg/python/Pyrex/Pyrex-0.9.3.1.tar.gz)
            You can also try the win32 version of the Pyrex installer,
            but I had some trouble making that work and eventually
            just downloaded the source and ran the python install
            script.  (It's possible my trouble was because I had been using
            the wrong Python version for a short time.)

        % cd experimental/pyrex-opengl
        % make          # should build the DLL directly.
        % cd ../../

        Edit selectMode.py, set TEST_PYREX_OPENGL to "True".

        % python atom.py

        When you enable atom selection, you should immediately see some
        colored spheres.

        I just followed this procedure on my laptop, so I'm reasonably
        confident about it.

    On Linux:

        Tested under Gentoo Linux with pyrex-0.9.3, pyopengl-2.0.0.44,
        dev-python/numeric-23.7, PyQt-3.14.1-r1,
        dev-python/imaging-1.1.4, and python-2.4.2 merged.  (Those are
        the ebuilds that that resulted on my system from the command:
        "emerge python numeric pyrex PyQt pyopengl dev-python/imaging")

        % cd experimental/pyrex-opengl
        % make          # should build the DSO directly.
        % cd ../../

        Edit selectMode.py, set TEST_PYREX_OPENGL to "True".

        % python atom.py

        When you enable atom selection, you should immediately see some
        colored spheres.

        I just followed this procedure on my laptop, so I'm somewhat
        confident about it.  But I ran it from "coLinux", which is a
        Linux kernel running side-by-side with Windows, and I ran
        ne-1 to the Cygwin/X server.  (www.colinux.org)  It actually
        ran pretty well.
