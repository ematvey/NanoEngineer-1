"""This is a demonstration of some very simple Qt ideas. Qt is so
complicated that you can't just sit down and write a GUI like you
could in Java or Tkinter. You need to start in Qt Designer.

Use designer-qt3 to tweak cruft.ui. Then run
pyuic cruft.ui > cruft.py    or just    make cruft.py
to produce a class that gets inherited by Crufty.

Qt Designer won't do everything you want. You sometimes need to
manually edit the XML in cruft.ui to accomplish things that it can't
do.
