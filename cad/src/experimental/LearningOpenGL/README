This is a bunch of small programming exercises to help me (Will) learn
about OpenGL. There are a few copies of the OpenGL Red Book online,
and the one I am working with currently is here:
http://fly.srk.fer.hr/~unreal/theredbook/

So the idea is to write a lot of little C programs of gradually
increasing complexity (or to just cut-and-paste them from the book,
with minimal tweaks). Hopefully one of these will turn out to be
pretty close to what we want.
