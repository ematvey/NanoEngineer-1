I have done all the raw rendering and now I just need to use ImageMagick
to do motion-blur, cross-fades, and add the nanosecond/rotation display.
Given a clear plan, that is relatively quick work, so I hope to get the
DVD in the mail to John some time in the next week.

Here is the last version of the video I did before we brought in John:
http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-199611355948259531

Here are the various animation speeds. This is really a note to myself
about how to do correct motion blur.0
Fast: fastpng/fast_cpk_png, use raw frames directly
	0.15 ps/sec (5 fs/frame)
Medium: fastpng/fast_cpk_png, average 4 frames
	0.6 ps/sec (20 fs/frame)
Slow: slowpng/slow_cpk_png, average 10 frames
	6 ps/sec (200 fs/frame)
Slow jumpy: slowpng/slow_cpk_png, use every 10th frame
	6 ps/sec (200 fs/frame)

All animations are done at 30 FPS.
CPK = van der Waals atom display, fat spherical atoms
B+S = ball-and-stick atom display ("tubes" display)

The sequence:
(1) Titles 1 & 2: Medium speed, CPK, 23 seconds
	I didn't render enough raw frames for this entire piece, so I
	ran for 8 seconds with title 1, then started over and re-ran the
	animation for 15 seconds for title 2. I have enough raw frames
	for 18 seconds of medium-speed animation.
(2) Cross fade: 5 secs medium CPK, half-second fade, 5 secs medium B+S, 
(3) Title 3: 18 seconds fast B+S (8 secs with title, 10 secs without)
(4) Title 4: 18 seconds medium B+S (8 secs with title, 10 secs without)
(5) Title 5: 18 seconds fast B+S (8 secs with title, 10 secs without)
(6) Titles 6 - 8: 25 seconds, fast jumpy B+S
(7) Cross fade: 5 secs slow jumpy B+S, half-second fade, 5 secs slow jumpy CPK
(8) Titles 9 & 10: 27 secs slow CPK (not jumpy)

Whenever there is no title on the screen, the nanoseconds and rotations
show in the upper left, in fixed-width font, with three digits after the
decimal point. Since adding these is trivial, I will produce all sequences
both with and without them, and you can decide when to cut them in or out.

My plan is to make a DVD with two top-level directories (with nsecs/rots,
and without) and in each of those, put eight subdirectories with the
640x480 frames for the eight pieces shown above.

==============================

I won't be doing anything with titles, but just for reference, here is
what was previously used for titles. I've used HTML tags to
notate line breaks, peragraphs, boldface, a horizontal dividing line (hr),
and indentation (blockqoute). Titles 7 and 8 appear along the bottom of
the screen.

2: The device shown is a low-friction bearing with a tight ring that holds a
	rotating shaft. <p> All dynamics are at room temperature (300K) with
	a shaft frequency of 5 GHz. Apparent motions will be compared at
	several display rates and with different imaging methods. <hr>
	Initial display rate: 0.6 ps per second <br>
	Imaging: multiple position samples per frame
3: Base rate: <b>0.15 ps per second</b> <p>
	At this speed, the thermal motion of individual atoms is clearly
	visible. Shaft rotation is almost imperceptible.
4: 4 times base rate: <b>0.6 ps per second</b> <p>
	At this speed, the thermal motion of larger structures becomes
	obvious. Shaft rotation remains inconspicuous.
5: 40 times base rate: <b>6.0 ps per second</b> <p>
	The 5 GHz rotation is conspicuous. Atomic vibrations are now a
	blur of motion.
	<blockquote><b>Each animation frame shows merged images from
	many position samples.</b></blockquote>
6: <b>Same rate, 6.0 ps per second, but imaging only one sample per frame.
	This omits realistic motion blur.</b><p>
	Imaging a single position sample per frame creates the false
	appearance that atoms oscillate at the frame rate. This illusion
	is common in molecular animations.
7: A stroboscopic illusion: motion speeds appear wrong
8: Realism requires multiple samples per frame
9: Covalent structures of the kind shown in this video can be realistically
	simulated using current molecular dynamics techniques.<p>
	Producing structures of this kind, however, will require molecular
	nanofabrication techniques that have yet to be developed.

I think that last one should say "POV-Ray" rather than "POVray". That seems
to be the spelling preferred by its developers.
