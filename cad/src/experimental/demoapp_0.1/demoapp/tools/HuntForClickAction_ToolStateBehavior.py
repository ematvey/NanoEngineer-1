    """
    Abstract class for one common kind of ToolStateBehavior,
    for use when the user is moving the mouse around to hunt for
    some action they can do by clicking or dragging. Provides for
    integrated code in the subclasses for what a click on something
    would do, used both for highlighting/tooltips during mouse motion
    and for actually doing it on mouse press.

    @see: other classes for fancier kinds of highlighting behavior
          (e.g. when the user might want to compare several possible
          actions and see highlighting for all of them).

    @see: other classes for similar behavior during a drag
          (tip & highlight for places where mouse *up* has certain effects),
          e.g. HuntForReleaseAction_ToolStateBehavior.
