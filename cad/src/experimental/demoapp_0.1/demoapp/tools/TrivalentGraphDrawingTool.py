TrivalentGraphDrawingTool.py - tool for drawing new nodes and edges into a trivalent graph

$Id: TrivalentGraphDrawingTool.py 13471 2008-07-15 23:13:45Z brucesmith $

bugs, fri eve 080613:
- sometimes app seemingly can get stuck; not seen recently
- might be fixed:
  can't drag an existing node i click in when no edge will be drawn by that click
  - not sure i like the lack of drag of node i connect edge to, either;
    but at least, if i click and it doesn't connect and has no rubberedge, i should be able to drag.
- lack of tip when it starts or just does an action is inconsistent;
  otoh the tip we want then might be better in a fixed bottom place
  than next to the cursor. plus we need prefs to turn off "empty space tips" and/or other tips.
  need to classify tips, then have pref for each kind, off or bottom or cursor.
  - mitigated by removing emoty space tips since rubber objs are sufficient
- should prohibit recconnecting two nodes that are already directly connected
  (ie making new edge identical to old one)
- since latest chg, has visual glitches (briefly seen tips that are now mostly gone)

sat aft:
- mouse leave doesn't stop showing the gray rubber node -- i guess we need to bind that event directly
- "drag this node" is wrong, you can also add an edge to it, or both... so fix tip,
  also fix behavior so if you do drag it, you're done, i.e. "drag it *or* add edge to it". tip: "drag or add edge".
- yellow *around* dragnode is distracting, should change it to *be* yellow.
- should make all these lines thickness 2


nfr:
- drag one node over another -> merge nodes (if let go)
- node cmenu command to dissolve node, merging edges, when node has exactly 2 edges
- want other tools, e.g. one for only making nodes, only dragging, only making edges, etc
