coding standards



assume the developer will run with python main.py normally,
or with python -O main.py for speed,
and the user will often use -O as well.

So don't assume asserts will fire (never use them as part of logic;
raise other exceptions for things that should be asserted even in production code).

And use __debug__ (sp?) to control general debugging options
(as pyglet does for opengl error checking).
