  If you are a developer who wants an installed release build of NE1 to load
most of its Python code (the code normally located in cad/src in cvs) from
a different directory than usual, find the source file main.py in the
place that the release builder copies it to (details below), and add a file
next to it named ALTERNATE_CAD_SRC_PATH, consisting of a single line giving
the absolute pathname in which cad/src files should be found. (This feature
may only work correctly if that pathname also ends with cad/src.)

  If a directory exists at that path, it will be prepended to sys.path,
so that Python imports will look in it first, and a flag and global
variable will be set here, so that other code can also behave differently
when this feature is in use. (This is intended to permit printing of startup
messages prominently warning the developer-user that this feature is being
used, and to permit startup or other code to improve the behavior of this
feature, for example by removing the usual location of files in cad/src
from sys.path (so that removed files don't still seem to be present),
by also looking for cad/plugins/* or sim.so in a different place, etc.)

  Finding the correct main.py file to place ALTERNATE_CAD_SRC_PATH next to:
At least on the Mac, the source file main.py is copied to a different place
than all other cad/src files (which remain as .pyc files in a .zip archive) --
though it is also left (unused) in the same place as they are. As of 070704,
the copied main.py is located inside NE1's .app folder, with a pathname like
NanoEngineer-1-version.app/Contents/Resources/main.py. So the new file should
have a name like NanoEngineer-1-version.app/Contents/Resources/ALTERNATE_CAD_SRC_PATH
and contents that look something like <your cvs dir>/cad/src on a single line.

  The motivation of this feature is to permit a developer to run NE1 from cvs
or other modified sources, but using the same libraries present in an
installed NE1, whether or not they're installed on that developer's system in
the usual way. This saves developers from having to install those libraries
or worry about whether they're the right version, and permits testing code
with more than one different set of such libraries. It also helps test for
bugs due to the possible dependence of code on its location in the filesystem.

  This feature is operative (when its special file is found) regardless of
whether NE1 is being run from a built release or from cvs, so don't check in an
ALTERNATE_CAD_SRC_PATH file to cvs! 

  This feature might work on Windows and Linux, but has only been tested on Mac
as of 070704. It's possible those platforms will require alternative ways of
modifying the installed NE1.

Implementation & design notes:

  This feature needs to be implemented entirely in main.py, and can't make use of any
normal "preference setting", since it has to know how to modify sys.path before we
import any other modules. (It's also good if it affects each installation of NE1
independently, but that requirement would only complicate the use of a prefs setting
rather than ruling it out.)

  One reason we implement this using a separate file (rather than just suggesting
that the developer-user edit the global definitions in this file directly) is to
make it less likely that a mistaken cvs commit will activate this feature for
everyone by default. Another reason is to make it more likely to work unchanged
on all platforms (in case finding and modifying this file is difficult on some
platforms).
