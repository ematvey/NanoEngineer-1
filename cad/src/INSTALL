Installation on Fedora Core 4
===============================

When installing FC4 on your computer, be sure to select KDE as your
graphical environment. Also select the "kde devel" package. This will
install several prerequisite packages directly from the CDROMs. In
addition, you will need three more packages:

freeglut-devel-2.2.0-16.i386.rpm
	Install this using "rpm -i". This must be done as root.

Numeric-24.0b2.tar.gz
	Unpack this tarball and install with "python setup.py install".
	This must also be done as root.

PyOpenGL-2.0.2.01.tar.gz
	Unpack this tarball and install with "python setup.py install".
	This must also be done as root. You will need to install
	freeglut-devel before you install this package.
