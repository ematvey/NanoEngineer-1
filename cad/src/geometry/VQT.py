VQT.py - Vectors, Quaternions, and [no longer in this file] Trackballs

Vectors are a simplified interface to the Numeric arrays.

A relatively full implementation of Quaternions
(but note that we use the addition operator to multiply them).

    right-handed coordinate frame, is the quaternion that rotates the standard
    axes into that reference frame (the frame has to be right handed, or there's

    Q(number) gives Q(1,0,0,0) [perhaps never used, not sure]
