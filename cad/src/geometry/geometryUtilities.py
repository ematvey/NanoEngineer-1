    Given basepos (an array of positions),
    compute and return an axis in one of various ways according to 'type' (choices are listed below),
    optionally adjusting the algorithm using aspect_threshhold (when are two dimensions close enough to count as circular),
    and numeric_threshhold (roughly, precision of coordinate values) (numeric_threshhold might be partly nim ###).
       Optional speed optimizations: if you know basepos is already_centered, you can say so;
    if (even better) you have the value of inertia_eigenvectors(basepos, already_centered = already_centered),
    you can pass that value so it doesn't have to be recomputed. (Computing it is the only way basepos is used in this routine.)
       The answer is always arbitrary in sign, so try to disambiguate it using (in order) whichever of near1, near2, and dflt
    is provided (by making it have positive dot product with the first one possible);
    but if none of those are provided and helpful (not perpendicular), return the answer with an arbitrary sign.
       If the positions require an arbitrary choice within a plane, and near1 is provided, try to choose the direction
    in that plane closest to near1; if they're all equally close (using numeric_threshhold), try near2 in the same way
    (ideally near2 should be perpendicular to near1).
       If the positions require a completely arbitrary choice, return dflt.
       Typical calls from the UI pass near1 = out of screen, near2 = up (parallel to screen), dflt = out of screen or None
    (depending on whether caller wants to detect the need to use dflt in order to print a warning). [#k guesses]
       Typical calls with no UI pass near1 = V(0,0,1), near2 = V(0,1,0), dflt = V(0,0,1).
       Choices of type (required argument) are:
    'normal' - try to return the shortest axis; if ambiguous, use near directions to choose within a plane,
       or return dflt for a blob. Works for 2 or more points; treats single point (or no points) as a blob.
       This should be used by rotary and linear motors, since they want to connect to atoms on a surface (intention as of 060119),
       and by viewNormalTo.
    'parallel' - try to return the longest axis; otherwise like 'normal'. This should be used by viewParallelTo.
    'chunk' - for slabs close enough to circles or squares (using aspect_threshhold), like 'normal', otherwise like 'parallel'.
       This is used for computing axes of chunks for purposes of how they interactively slide in certain UI modes.
       (Note that viewParallelTo and viewNormalTo, applied to a chunk or perhaps to jigs containing sets of atoms,
       should compute their own values as if applied to the same atoms, since the chunk or jig will compute its axis in
       a different way, both in choice of type argument, and in values of near1, near2, and dflt.)
