runSim.py -- setting up and running the simulator, for Simulate or Minimize
(i.e. the same code that would change if the simulator interface changed),
and part of the implementation of user-visible commands for those operations.

History:

Mark created a file of this name, but that was renamed to SimSetup.py
by bruce on 050325.

Bruce 050324 pulled in lots of existing code for running the simulator
(and some code for reading its results) into this file, since that fits
its name. That existing code was mostly by Mark and Huaicai, and was
partly cleaned up by Bruce, who also put some of it into subclasses
of the experimental CommandRun class. (CommandRun and its subclasses
were subsequently moved into another file, sim_commandruns.py.)

Bruce 050331 is splitting writemovie into several methods in more than
one subclass (eventually) of a new SimRunner class.

Bruce 051115 some comments and code cleanup; add #SIMOPT wherever a
simulator executable command-line flag is hardcoded.

Bruce 051231 partly-done code for using pyrex interface to sim; see use_dylib

[and much more, by many developers, not recorded]

Bruce 080321 split out sim_commandruns.py and sim_aspect.py into their
own files.

Subject: Minimize trace file format

Here's the code that writes the trace file during minimize:

    write_traceline("%4d %20f %20f %s %s\n", frameNumber, rms, max_force, callLocation, message);

You can count on the first three not changing.

Note that with some debugging flags on you get extra lines of this
same form that have other info in the same places.  I think you can
just use the rms value for progress and it will do strange things if
you have that debugging flag on.  If you want to ignore those lines,
you can only use lines that have callLocation=="gradient", and that
should work well.

# Run the simulator and tell it to create a dpb or xyz trajectory file.
# [bruce 050324 moved this here from fileIO.py. It should be renamed to run_simulator,
#  since it does not always try to write a movie, but always tries to run the simulator.
#  In fact (and in spite of not always making a movie file),
#  maybe it should be a method of the Movie object,
#  which is used before the movie file is made to hold the params for making it.
#  (I'm not sure how much it's used when we'll make an .xyz file for Minimize.)
#  If it's not made a Movie method, then at least it should be revised
#  to accept the movie to use as an argument; and, perhaps, mainly called by a Movie method.
#  For now, I renamed assy.m -> assy.current_movie, and never grab it here at all
#  but let it be passed in instead.] ###@@@
