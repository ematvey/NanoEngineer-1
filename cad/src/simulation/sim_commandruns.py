            # Rationale for adding monovalent atoms to the selection before

            #
            # (Refer to comments for sim_aspect.__init__.) Why is it safe to add
            # monovalent atoms to a selection? Let's look at what happens during a
            # local minimization.
            #
            # While minimizing, we want to simulate as if the entire rest of the
            # part is grounded, and only our selection of atoms is free to move. The
            # most obvious approach would be to minimize all the atoms in the part
            # while applying anchors to the atoms that aren't in the selection. But
            # minimizing all the atoms, especially if the selection is small, is very
            # wasteful. Applying the simulator to atoms is expensive and we want to
            # minimize as few atoms as possible.
            #
            # [revision, bruce 080513: this discussion applies for Adjust,
            #  but the policy for Minimize is being changed to always include
            #  all atoms, even if most of them are anchored,
            #  re nfr bug 2848 item 2.]
            #
            # A more economical approach is to anchor the atoms for two layers going
            # out from the selection. The reason for going out two layers, and not just
            # one layer, is that we need bond angle terms to simulate accurately. When
            # we get torsion angles we will probably want to bump this up to three
            # layers. [Now we're doing three layers -- bruce 080507]
            #
            # Imagine labeling all the atoms in the selection with zero. Then take the
            # set of unlabeled atoms that are bonded to a zero-labeled atom, and label
            # all the atoms in that set with one. Next, take the set of yet-unlabeled
            # atoms that are bonded to a one-labeled atom, and label the atoms in that
            # set with two. The atoms labeled one and two become our first and second
            # layers, and we anchor them during the minimization.
            #
            # In sim_aspect.__init__, the labels for zero, one and two correspond
            # respectively to membership in the dictionaries self._moving_atoms,
            # self._boundary1_atoms, and self._boundary2_atoms.
            #
            # If an atom in the selection is anchored, we don't need to go two layers
            # out from that atom, only one layer. So we can label it with one, even
            # though it's a member of the selection and would normally be labeled with
            # zero. The purpose in doing this is to give the simulator a few less atoms
            # to worry about.
            #
            # If a jig includes one of the selected atoms, but additionally includes
            # atoms outside the selection, then it may not be obvious how to simulate
            # that jig. For the present, the only jig that counts in a local
            # minimization is an anchor, because all the other jigs are too complicated
            # to simulate.
            #
            # The proposed fix here has the effect that monovalent atoms bonded to
            # zero-labeled atoms are also labeled zero, rather than being labeled one,
            # so they are allowed to move. Why is this OK to do?
            #
            # (1) Have we violated the assumption that the rest of the part is locked
            # down? Yes, as it applies to those monovalent atoms, but they are
            # presumably acceptable violations, since bug 1240 is regarded as a bug.
            #
            # (2) Have we unlocked any bond lengths or bond angles that should remain
            # locked? Again, only those which involve (and necessarily end at) the
            # monovalent atoms in question. The same will be true when we introduce
            # torsion terms.
            #
            # (3) Have we lost any ground on the jig front? If a jig includes one or
            # more of the monovalent atoms, possibly - but the only jigs we are
            # simulating in this case is anchors, and those will be handled correctly.
            # Remember that anchored atoms are only extended one layer, not two, but
            # with a monovalent atom bonded to a selected atom, no extension is
            # possible at all.
            #
            # One can debate about whether bug 1240 should be regarded as a bug. But
