###@@@ this will be a subclass of SimRun, like Movie will be... no, that's wrong.
# Movie will be subclass of SimResults, or maybe not since those need not be a class

        atoms is a list of atoms within the part (e.g. the selected ones,
        for Minimize Selection); we copy it in case caller modifies it later.
        [Note that this class has no selection object and does not look at
        (or change) the "currently selected" state of any atoms,
        though some of its comments are worded as if it did.]
           We become a simulatable aspect for simulating motion of those atoms
        (and of any singlets bonded to them, since user has no way to select
        those explicitly),
        starting from their current positions, with a "boundary layer" of other
        directly bonded atoms (if any) held fixed during the simulation.
        [As of 050408 this boundary will be changed from thickness 1 to thickness 2
         and its own singlets, if any, will also be anchored rather than moving.
         This is because we're approximating letting the entire rest of the Part
         be anchored, and the 2nd layer of atoms will constrain bond angles on the
         first layer, so leaving it out would be too different from what we're
         approximating.]
        (If any given atoms have Anchor jigs, those atoms are also treated as
        boundary atoms and their own bonds are only explored to an additional depth
        of 1 (in terms of bonds) to extend the boundary.
        So if the user explicitly selects a complete boundary of Anchored atoms,
        only their own directly bonded real atoms will be additionally anchored.)
           All atoms not in our list or its 2-thick boundary are ignored --
        so much that our atoms might move and overlap them in space.
           We look at jigs which attach to our atoms,
        but only if we know how to sim them -- we might not, if they also
        touch other atoms. For now, we only look at Anchor jigs (as mentioned
        above) since this initial implem is only for Minimize. When we have
        Simulate Selection, this will need revisiting. [Update: we also look at
        other jigs, now that we have Enable In Minimize for motors.]
           If we ever need to emit history messages
        (e.g. warnings) we'll do it using a global history variable (NIM)
        or via part.assy. For now [050406] none are emitted.
