History:
2008-05-13 Created

TODO: 2008-05-13
This is an initial implementation subjected to heavy revision. Initial purpose
is just to RESIZE given structures (of same type) together. Can be extended 
in future but needs refactoring then.
- This class assumes attr currentStruct for the current command and also
  assumes a method currentStruct.getAxisEndPoints! Note that this will be true 
  for currentStruct = DnaSegment, CntSegment BUT NOT FOR DnaStrand 
  so when we support resizing multiple dnastrands, this must be refactored.   
- Created to initially support resizing multiple dna segments. Can be extended
    for other commands such as strand, nanotube resizing. 
    This class assumes certain things such as the struct being edited will have 
    resize handles. If it is not the case, refactoring is needed to move methods
    such as self.updateAverageEndPoints() to the subclasses. 
- Need safety features to make sure that structures provided by the 
   list of structures (in self._structList) are of valid structure type (e.g.
   if you are resizing multiple Dnasegments, self._structList must contain 
   all instances of DnaSegment only.
