GraphicsMode_API.py -- API class for whatever is used as a GraphicsMode

History:

bruce 071028 split this out of GraphicsMode.py, in which it was
called anyGraphicsMode. All external refs to anyGraphicsMode
are now refs to GraphicsMode_API.

TODO:

Add all the attributes and methods in the true GraphicsMode API
to this class (to fully document the API). Use null methods and
values (legal to use, which do nothing) unless no real GraphicsMode
can be correct without overriding them (like for Command.commandName).

See also the TODO comment in module GraphicsMode.
