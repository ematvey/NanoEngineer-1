History:

bruce 071009 split modes.py into Command.py and GraphicsMode.py,
leaving only temporary compatibility mixins in modes.py.
For prior history see modes.py docstring before the split.

TODO:

A lot of methods in class GraphicsMode are private helper methods,
available to subclasses and/or to default implems of public methods,
but are not yet named as private or otherwise distinguished
from API methods. We should turn anyGraphicsMode into GraphicsMode_API
[done as of 071028],
add all the API methods to it, and rename the other methods
in class GraphicsMode to look private.

        Use this to drag objects by points other than their centers,

        Arguments:
        - <point> should be the current center (or other reference) point of the object.
        - The return value will be a new position for the same reference point as <point> comes from
          (which the caller should move the object to match, perhaps subject to drag-constraints).
        - <event> should be an event whose .pos().x() and .pos.y() supply window coordinates for the mouse
        - <offset> should be a vector (fixed throughout the drag) from the center of the object
          to the actual dragpoint (i.e. to the point in 3d space which should appear to be gripped by the mouse,
          usually the 3d position of a pixel which was drawn when drawing the object
          and which was under the mousedown which started the drag).

        By convention, modes can store self.drag_offset in leftDown and pass it as <offset>.

        Note: we're not designed for objects which rotate while being dragged, as in e.g. dragSinglets,
        though using this routine for them might work better than nothing (untested ##k). In such cases
        it might be better to pass a different <offset> each time (not sure), but the only perfect
        solution is likely to involve custom code which is fully aware of how the object's
        center and its dragpoint differ, and of how the offset between them rotates as the object does.

               have been due to a change in current graphicsMode.
