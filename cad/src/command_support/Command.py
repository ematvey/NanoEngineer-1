History:

bruce 071009 split modes.py into Command.py and GraphicsMode.py,
leaving only temporary compatibility mixins in modes.py.
For prior history see modes.py docstring before the split.

TODO:

A lot of methods in class Command are private helper methods,
available to subclasses and/or to default implems of public methods,
but are not yet named as private or otherwise distinguished
from API methods. We should turn anyCommand into Command_API,
add all the API methods to it, and rename the other methods
in class Command to look private.

Methods such as basicCommand.Done, basicCommand._enterMode, 
basicCommand._exitMode and CommandSequencer.start_using_mode need cleanup. 
(Needs to be done together)

                       to False for a regular temporary mode exit (such as

                       Atoms mode , then invokes Pan tool, and hits 'Escape' key
                       the program, based on this flag decides whether to exit 
                       the 'Pan mode' or 'also exit build Atoms mode' .  In this 
                       case, (Escape key exit) the flag is set to False by the 
                       caller, so program knows that user actually didn't press

    Subclass this class to create a new Command, or more often,
    a new general type of Command. This class contains code which
    most Command classes need. [See basicCommand docstring about
    how and when that class will be merged with this class.]

    A Command is a temporary mode of interaction
    for the entire UI which the user enters in order to accomplish
    a specific operation or kind of interaction. Some Commands exit
    very soon and on their own, but most can endure indefinitely
    until the user activates a Done or Cancel action to exit them.

    An instance of a Command subclass corresponds to a single run
    of a command, which may or may not have actually become active
    and/or still be active. Mode-like commands may repeatedly become
    active due to separate user actions, whereas operation-like commands
    are more likely to be active just once (with new instances of the
    same class being created when the user again asks for the same
    operation to occur).
