Command.py -- provides class basicCommand, superclass for commands

History:

bruce 071009 split modes.py into Command.py and GraphicsMode.py,
leaving only temporary compatibility mixins in modes.py.
For prior history see modes.py docstring before the split.

Bruce & Ninad did a big command sequencer refactoring, circa 080812

TODO:

A lot of methods in class Command are private helper methods,
available to subclasses and/or to default implems of public methods,
but are not yet named as private or otherwise distinguished
from API methods. We should turn anyCommand into Command_API,
add all the API methods to it, and rename the other methods
in class Command to look private.

    most Command classes need. [See basicCommand docstring about
    how and when that class will be merged with this class.]

    A Command is a temporary mode of interaction
    for the entire UI which the user enters in order to accomplish
    a specific operation or kind of interaction. Some Commands exit
    very soon and on their own, but most can endure indefinitely
    until the user activates a Done or Cancel action to exit them.

    An instance of a Command subclass corresponds to a single run
    of a command, which may or may not have actually become active
    and/or still be active. Mode-like commands may repeatedly become
    active due to separate user actions, whereas operation-like commands
    are more likely to be active just once (with new instances of the
    same class being created when the user again asks for the same
    operation to occur).
