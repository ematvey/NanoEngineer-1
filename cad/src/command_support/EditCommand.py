History:

- Originally created as 'GeometryGeneratorBaseClass'. It shared common code with 
GeneratorBaseClass but had some extra features to support creation and edition 
of a 'Plane' [June-Sept 2007]. It was split out of ReferenceGeometry.py
- Before 2007-12-28, Editcommand was known as 'EditController' 


Ninad 2007-09-17: Code cleanup to split ui part out of this class. 
Ninad 2007-10-05: Major changes. Refactored GeometryGeneratorBaseClass 
                  and surrounding code. Also renamed GeometryGeneratorBaseClass 
                  to EditCommand, similar changes in surrounding code
Ninad 2007-10-24: Changes to convert the old structure generators
                  such as DnaGenerator / DnaDuplexGenerator to use the 
                  EditCommand class (and their PMs to use EditCommand_PM)
Ninad 2007-12-26: Converted editControllers into Commands on commandSequencer

TODO:
- Need to cleanup docstrings. 
- In subclasses such as DnaDuplex_EditCommand, the method createStructure do 
  nothing (user is not immediately creating a structure) .
  Need to clean this up a bit in this class and in the  surrounding code
- New subclass DnaDuplex_EditCommand adds the structure as a node in the MT 
  in its _createStructure method. This should also be implemented for 
  following sublasses:  Plane_EditCommand, LineEditCommand, motor
  editcommand classes.

    EditCommand class that provides a editCommand object. 
    The client can call three public methods defined in this class to acheive 
    various things. 
    1. runCommand -- Used to run this editCommand . Depending upon the
       type of editCommand it is, it does various things. The most common 
       thing it does is to create and show  a property manager (PM) The PM 
       is used by the editCommand to define the UI for the model
       which this editCommand creates/edits. 
       See DnaDuplex_EditCommand.runCommand for an example 
    2. createStructure -- Used directly by the client when it already knows 
       input parameters for the structure being generated. This facilitates 
       imeediate preview of the model being created when you execute this 
       command. 
       See self.createStructure  which is the default implementation used
       by many subclasses such as RotaryMotor_EditCommand etc. 
    3. editStructure -- Used directly by the client when it needs to edit 
       an already created structure. 
       See self.editStructure for details.
