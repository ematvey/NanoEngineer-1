Recompute structural bond orders when necessary.

This is needed for bonds between atoms whose atomtypes make p orbitals
available for bonding, to check whether pi bonds are formed,
whether they're aromatic or double or triple, to check for
radicals (pi systems containing unpaired electrons),
and to notice graphite.

(Much of the above is not yet implemented.)

History:

bruce 050627 started this as part of supporting higher-order bonds.

bruce 071108 split out the general orchestration and registration
part of this into master_model_updater.py, leaving only the bond-
type- and atom-type- updating code in this file.

    [should be called only from _master_model_updater, which is in turn
     called from env.do_post_event_updates]
    
    This should be called at the end of every user event which might affect
    the atomtypes or bond-sets of any atoms or singlets, which are passed as the
    values of the dict changed_structure_atoms, which we should not modify
    (and which no other code will modify while we use it). (As it happens,
    the caller will clear that dict after we return.)

    This function will either update, or record as needing update, the
    structural bond orders and associated data for all
    real atoms, real bonds, and open bonds which might be in pi systems
    (or which were, but aren't anymore).
    [And it might do more. #k if so, #doc that here.]

    Since it must be fast, it won't do work which leads it away from the actual
    atoms it's passed, and it will leave existing bond orders alone whenever
    they're locally consistent with the current atomtypes. That is, it will only
    act when there are local inconsistencies, and it will only fix them when
    this can be done on just the atoms it was passed (or their bonds), and in
    a reasonably unambiguous way; whenever it thinks a more global update is
    needed, it will record this fact (and the affected atoms) so the user can
    be advised that a global bond-update is needed.

    It will assume that interpart bonds (if any) have already been broken.
