To remake the standalone simulator:
  make clean # this doesn't yet remove the python-or-perl-produced source files
  make

To remake the Pyrex extension:
  make clean # might not clean enough to force this remake; try touching *.pyx
  make pyx

To test the Pyrex extension, see its module docstring in sim.pyx:

  python -c "import sim; sim.test()"

For other info which might or might not be more up-to-date than this,
