CVS branching is sometimes usefully done with small subsets of a
source tree. In that case, you would change the branch file to be
a list of the files specific to your branch, like this:

----- 8< -----
simulator.h
printers.h
part.c
minimize.c
readmmp.c
writemovie.c
debug.h
----- 8< -----

When you want to check out your branch, you first check out the
entire tree, then check out your branch on top of it:

cvs co sim
cd sim/src
cvs up -r wware_mybranch_20051228 branch
cvs up -r wware_mybranch_20051228 `cat branch`

When you've done some work in your branch and you want to commit
it, use this command:

cvs commit -r wware_mybranch_20051228 `cat branch`

and if the contents of the branch files changes (you need
to branch more files, or fewer, or different ones), then:

cvs commit -r wware_mybranch_20051228 branch
